  <h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h3>


  <p>Among the many wonderful achievements of the present
      century there is none more wonderful than the recovery
      and decipherment of the monuments of ancient Nineveh.
      For generations the great oppressing city had slept
      buried beneath the fragments of its own ruins, its history
      lost, its very site forgotten. Its name had passed
      into the region of myth even in the age of the classical
      writers of Greece and Rome; Ninos or Nineveh had
      become a hero-king about whom strange legends were
      told, and whose conquests were fabled to have extended
      from the Mediterranean to India. Little was known of
      the history of the mighty Assyrian Empire beyond what
      might be learnt from the Old Testament, and that little
      was involved in doubt and obscurity. Scholars wrote
      long treatises to reconcile the statements of Greek historians
      with those of Scripture, but they only succeeded
      in evolving theories which were contradicted and overthrown
      by the next writer. There was none so bold as
      to suggest that the history and life of Assyria were still
      lying hidden beneath the ground, ready to rise up and
      disclose their secrets at the touch of a magician's rod.
      The rod was the spade and the patient sagacity which

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>

      deciphered and interpreted what the spade had found.
      It might have been thought that the cuneiform or wedge-shaped
      inscriptions of Assyria could never be forced to
      reveal their mysteries. The language in which they
      were written was unknown, and all clue to the meaning
      of the multitudinous characters that composed them had
      long been lost. No bilingual text came to the aid of the
      decipherer like the Rosetta Stone, whose Greek inscription
      had furnished the key to the meaning of the
      Egyptian hieroglyphics. Nevertheless the great feat
      was accomplished. Step by step the signification of the
      cuneiform characters and the words they concealed was
      made out, until it is now possible to translate an ordinary
      Assyrian text with as much ease and certainty as a page
      of the Old Testament.</p>

  <p>And the revelation that awaited the decipherer was
      startling in the extreme. The ruins of Nineveh yielded
      not only sculptures and inscriptions carved in stone, but
      a whole library of books. True, the books are written
      upon clay, and not on paper, but they are none the less
      real books, dealing with all the subjects of knowledge
      known at the time they were compiled, and presenting
      us with a clear and truthful reflection of Assyrian
      thought and belief. We can not only trace the architectural
      plans of the Assyrian palaces, and study the
      bas-reliefs in which the Assyrians have pictured themselves
      and the life they led; we can also penetrate to
      their inmost thoughts and feelings, and read their history
      as they have told it themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

  <p>It is a strange thing to examine for the first time one
      of the clay tablets of the old Assyrian library. Usually
      it has been more or less broken by the catastrophe of
      that terrible day when Nineveh was captured by its
      enemies, and the palace and library burnt and destroyed
      together. But whether it is a fragment or a complete
      tablet, it is impossible not to handle it reverently when
      cleaning it from the dirt with which its long sojourn in
      the earth has encrusted it, and spelling out its words for
      the first time for more than 2,000 years. When last the
      characters upon it were read, it was in days when Assyria
      was still a name of terror, and the destruction that God's
      prophets had predicted was still to come. When its last
      reader laid it aside, Judah had not as yet undergone the
      chastisement of the Babylonish exile, the Old Testament
      was an uncompleted volume, the kingdom of the Messiah
      a promise of the distant future. We are brought face to
      face, as it were, with men who were the contemporaries
      of Isaiah, of Hezekiah, of Ahaz; nay, of men whose
      names have been familiar to us since we first read the
      Bible by our mother's side.</p>

  <p>Tiglath-Pileser and Sennacherib can never again be
      to us mere names. We possess the records which they
      caused to be written, and in which they told the story of
      their campaigns in Palestine. The records are not copies
      of older texts, with all the errors that human fallibility
      causes copyists and scribes to make. They are the
      original documents which were recited to the kings who
      ordered them to be compiled, and who may have held

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>

      them in their own hands. The gulf of centuries and
      forgetfulness that has divided us from Sennacherib is
      filled up when we read the account of his invasion of
      Judah, which seems to come from his own lips. Never
      again can the heroes of the Old Testament be to us as
      lay-figures, whose story is told by a voice that comes
      from a dark and unreal past. The voice is now become
      a living one, and we can realise that Isaiah and those of
      whom Isaiah wrote were men of flesh and blood like
      ourselves, with the same passions, the same needs, the
      same temptations.</p>

  <p>This realisation of Old Testament history is not the
      only result of the recovery of Assyria upon Biblical
      studies. It is a very important result, but there are
      others besides of equal importance. One of these is the
      unexpected confirmation of the correctness of Holy Writ
      which Assyrian discovery has afforded. The later history
      of the Old Testament no longer stands alone. Once
      it was itself the sole witness for the truth of the narratives
      it contains. Classical history or legend dealt with
      other lands and other ages; there were no documents
      besides those contained in the Old Testament to which
      we could appeal in support of its statements. All is
      changed now. The earth has yielded up its secrets; the
      ancient civilisation of Assyria has stepped forth again
      into the light of day, and has furnished us with records,
      the authenticity of which none can deny, which run side
      by side with those of the Books of Kings, confirming,
      explaining, and illustrating them. It has been said that

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>

      just at the moment when sceptical criticism seemed to
      have achieved its worst, and to have resolved the narratives
      of the Old Testament into myths or fables, God's
      Providence was raising up from the grave of centuries a
      new and unimpeachable witness for their truth. Indeed,
      so strikingly was this the case, that one of the objections
      brought against the correctness of Assyrian decipherment
      in its early days was that Assyrian monarchs could
      never have concerned themselves with petty kingdoms
      like those of Samaria and Judah, as the decipherers made
      them do. Before the cuneiform monuments were interpreted,
      no one could have suspected that they would
      have poured such a flood of light upon Old Testament
      history.</p>

  <p>This light is manifold. The very language of the
      inscriptions has helped to explain difficult passages in
      the Hebrew Bible. Assyrian turns out to be very closely
      related to Hebrew, as closely related, in fact, as two
      strongly marked English dialects are to one another.
      There is no other Semitic language (except, of course,
      Phœnician, which is practically the same as Hebrew)
      which is so nearly allied to it. And thanks to the
      library of Nineveh, and its lexicons and lists of synonymous
      words, we have a larger literature, and a larger
      vocabulary, to draw upon in the case of Assyrian than
      we have in the case of Hebrew. The consequence is
      that Assyrian may sometimes settle the meaning of a
      word which occurs only once or very rarely in the Old
      Testament. Thus the word <em>z'bh&ucirc;l</em>, which Hebrew

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>

      scholars had supposed to mean 'a dwelling,' is shown
      by the Assyrian texts to signify a 'height,' so that in
      1 Kings viii. 13, Solomon does not declare to God that
      he had built Him 'an house to dwell in,' as the
      Authorised Version renders the passage, but 'a lofty
      temple.' Naturally words of Assyrian origin, like Rab-shakeh
      and Tartan, have first received their explanation
      from the decipherment of the Assyrian inscriptions.
      They are not proper names, but titles, the Rab-shakeh
      being 'the chief of the princes,' or Vizier, and the
      Tartan, the commander-in-chief.</p>

  <p>But not only do we find parallels to Hebrew in the
      individual words of Assyrian, we also find parallel
      expressions which illustrate and explain those of the
      Hebrew text. We all remember the statement that the
      'Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
      and fire from the Lord out of heaven.' The
      same phrase occurs in an unpublished Accadian hymn
      addressed to a deity whose name is lost, but who was
      probably Rimmon the Air-god. The Accadian original
      describes him as 'raining fire and stones upon the
      enemy,' which the Assyrian translation changes into
      'raining stones and fire upon the foe' in exact conformity
      with the Hebrew phrase. The familiar expression
      'the Lord of Hosts,' similarly finds its analogue and
      illustration in the common Assyrian title of the supreme god
      Assur: 'lord of the legions of heaven and earth,' these
      legions being the multitudinous spirits and angels whose
      home was in 'the heaven above and the earth below.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

  <p>We can hardly speak here of the accounts of the
      Creation, the Deluge, and the Tower of Babel, to which
      Mr. George Smith gave the name of 'the Chaldean
      Genesis,' and which agree so closely with the corresponding
      accounts in the Hebrew Book of Genesis.
      Though found in the library of Nineveh, they are really
      copies of older Babylonian works, and therefore belong
      rather to Babylonian than to Assyrian history. It is
      only the account of the Creation in six days which may
      perhaps be of purely Assyrian origin. What a resemblance
      it offers to the first chapter of Genesis will be
      seen from the extracts from it in the chapter on Assyrian
      Religion.</p>

  <p>It is in the domain of history that the light cast upon
      Old Testament Scripture by Assyrian research has been
      fullest and strongest. No one can read the sketch of
      Assyrian history as revealed by the monuments which
      is given in the following pages, without perceiving how
      important it is for the proper understanding of the
      ancient Scriptures. For the first time the prophecies in
      Isaiah which refer to a capture of Jerusalem receive
      their explanation, and the sceptical criticism is answered
      which found in them a prediction of events that never
      took place. The chapter in which Isaiah describes the
      onward march of the Assyrian host against Jerusalem
      (ch. x.) is no 'ideal' description of 'an ideal campaign,'
      the verses in which he tells us of the sufferings endured
      by the beleaguered inhabitants of the Jewish capital
      (ch. xxii.) are no 'exaggerated account of a possible

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>

      catastrophe,' the prophecies in which he declares that
      the devoted city was about to fall into the hands of its
      enemies (x. 34, xxii. 14) were not unfulfilled threats.
      We learn from the inscriptions of Sargon that already,
      ten years before the campaign of his son Sennacherib,
      the Assyrian monarch had swept through 'the wide-spread
      land of Judah,' and had made it a tributary
      province. It was not the army of Sennacherib to which
      Isaiah was alluding on the day whereon he declared that
      the Assyrian host was at Nob, only a short half-hour to
      the north of Jerusalem, but the more terrible veterans of
      Sargon who marched against the holy city along the
      northern road. Similar light is thrown by the Assyrian
      monuments upon another prophecy of Isaiah, in which
      he pronounces the doom upon the land of Egypt
      (ch. xix.). The prophecy has sometimes been referred
      by critics to a later age than that of the great prophet;
      but the records of Esar-haddon prove that it is strictly
      applicable to his time, and to his time only. The
      unexpected revelation they have made to us of the
      Assyrian conquest of Egypt, and its division into twenty
      vassal satrapies shows us who was the 'cruel lord' and
      'fierce king' into whose hands the Egyptians were
      given, and paints the picture of an epoch in which 'the
      Egyptians' fought 'every one against his brother, and
      every one against his neighbour; city against city, and
      kingdom against kingdom.' The Isaianic authorship of
      'the burden of Egypt' can never again be denied.</p>

  <p>Nahum, again, we can now read with a new interest

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>

      and a new understanding. The very date of his prophecy,
      so long disputed, can be fixed approximately by
      the reference it contains to the sack of No-Amon or
      Thebes (iii. 8). The prophecy was delivered hard upon
      sixty years before the fall of Nineveh, when the Assyrian
      Empire was at the height of its prosperity, and mistress
      of the Eastern world. Human foresight could little
      have imagined that so great and terrible a power was so
      soon to disappear. And yet at the very moment when
      it seemed strongest and most secure, the Jewish prophet
      was uttering a prediction which the excavations of Botta
      and Layard have shown to have been carried out
      literally in fact. As we thread our way among the ruins
      of Nineveh, or trace the after history of the deserted
      and forgotten site, we see everywhere the fulfilment of
      Nahum's prophecy. Of the words that he pronounced
      against the doomed city, there is none which has not
      come to pass.</p>

  <p>Those who would learn how marvellously the monuments
      of Assyria illustrate and corroborate the pages of
      sacred history, need only compare the records they
      contain with the narratives of the Books of Kings which
      relate to the same period. The one complements and
      supplies the missing chapters given by the other. The
      Bible informs us why Sennacherib left Hezekiah
      unpunished, and never despatched another army to
      Palestine; the cuneiform annals explain the causes of
      his murder, and the reason of the flight of his sons to
      Ararat or Armenia. The single passage in Scripture in

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>

      which the name of Sargon is mentioned, no longer
      remains isolated and unintelligible; we have no longer
      any need to identify him with Tiglath-Pileser, or
      Shalmaneser, or any other Assyrian prince with whom
      the fancy of older commentators confounded him; we
      now know that he was one of the most powerful of
      Assyrian conquerors, and we have his own independent
      testimony to that siege and capture of Ashdod which is
      the occasion of the mention of his name in Scripture.
      Between the history of the monuments and the history
      of the Bible there is perpetual contact; and the voice
      of the monuments is found to be in strict harmony with
      that of the Old Testament.</p>

  <p>Before concluding this Preface, I have to thank Mr.
      W. G. Hird for his kindness in undertaking the task of
      compiling an Index to the volume.</p>

  <p>Assyria was the name given to the district which had
      been called 'the land of Assur' by its own inhabitants.
      Assur, however, had originally been the name, not of a
      country, but of a city founded in remote times on the
      western bank of the Tigris, midway between the Greater
      and the Lesser Zab. It was the primitive capital of the
      district in which it stood, and to which, accordingly, it
      lent its name. It seems to have been built by a people
      who spoke an agglutinative language, like the languages
      of the modern Fins and Turks, and who were afterwards
      supplanted by the Semitic Assyrians. The name in
      their language probably signified 'water-boundary.'
      When the country was occupied by the Semitic Assyrians
      the name was slightly changed, so as to assume
      the form of a word which in Assyrian meant 'gracious.'</p>

  <p>It so happened that Assyrian mythology knew of a
      deity who represented the firmament, and was addressed

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>

      as Sar. The name of Sar came in time to be confused
      with that of Assur, the divine patron of the Assyrian
      capital, the result being that Assur signified not only a
      city and country, but also the supreme deity worshipped
      by their inhabitants. Assur, in fact, became the divine
      impersonation of the power and constitution of Assyria;
      at the same time he was also 'the gracious' god and the
      prim&aelig;val firmament of heaven.</p>

  <p>Assur, whose ruins are now called Kalah Sherghat,
      did not always remain the capital of Assyria. Its place
      was taken by a group of cities some 60 miles to the
      north, above the Greater Zab, and on the eastern side of
      the Tigris, namely, Nineveh, Calah, and Dur-Sargon.
      The foundation of Nineveh, the modern Kouyunjik,
      probably goes back to as early an age as that of Assur,
      but it was not until a much later period that it became
      an important city, and supplanted the older capital of
      the kingdom. Calah, now called Nimr&ucirc;d, though built
      some four centuries before, was not made the seat of
      royalty until the reigns of Assur-natsir-pal and Shalmaneser
      II, in the 9th century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and
      Dur-Sargon (the modern Khorsabad), as its name implies, was
      the creation of Sargon. Instead of Dur-Sargon the Book of
      Genesis (x. 11) mentions Resen 'between Nineveh and
      Calah.' The site of Resen has not been identified,
      though its name has been met with in the Assyrian
      inscriptions under the form of Res-eni, 'the head of the
      spring.'</p>

  <p>The passage of Genesis in which Resen is referred to

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>

      unfortunately admits of a double translation. If we
      adopt the rendering of the margin, and translate 'out of
      that land he went forth into Assyria and builded
      Nineveh,' we might infer that Nineveh and its neighbouring
      towns had no existence before the days when
      Babylonian emigrants settled in the territory of the city
      of Assur, and superseded its older inhabitants. However
      this may be, we know from the cuneiform monuments
      that the rise of Assyria did not take place until
      the Babylonian monarchy was already growing old.
      The country afterwards known as Assyria had been
      comprised in Gutium or Kurdistan, a name which has
      been identified, with great probability, by Sir H.
      Rawlinson, with the Goyyim or 'nations' of Genesis xiv.
      over which Tidal was king. There seems to have been
      a time when the rulers of Assur were mere governors
      appointed by the Babylonian monarchs; at all events,
      the earliest of whom we know do not give themselves
      the title of king, but use a word which signifies
      'viceroy' in the Chaldean inscriptions.</p>

  <p>These viceroys, however, managed eventually to shake
      off the yoke of their Babylonian masters, and one of
      them, Bel-kapkapi by name, established an independent
      kingdom at Assur in the 17th or 16th century before
      our era. His kingdom extended on both sides of the
      Tigris, and doubtless included the country north of the
      Greater Zab, where Nineveh was situated. The exact
      frontiers of Assyria, however, were never accurately
      fixed. They varied with the military power and conquests

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>

      of its monarchs. Sometimes portions of the
      plateau of Mesopotamia on the west were comprehended
      within it, as well as the country through which the
      Tigris flowed, as far south as the borders of Babylonia,
      and as far north as the Kurdish mountains. At other
      times Assyria was confined to the narrow space within
      which its great cities stood.</p>

  <p>The inhabitants of Assyria belonged to the Semitic
      stock, that is to say, they were allied in blood and
      language to the Hebrews, the Aram&aelig;ans, and the
      Arabs. The older population had been either expelled
      or destroyed. The Assyrians thus differed from the
      Babylonians, who were a mixed race, partly Semitic
      and partly non-Semitic. The non-Semitic element is
      generally termed Accadian; it spoke agglutinative
      dialects, and was the original possessor of the plain
      of Chald&aelig;a. The Accadians invented the cuneiform
      system of writing, founded the chief cities and civilisation
      of Babylonia, and erected the earliest Babylonian
      monuments with which we are acquainted. It was only
      gradually that they yielded to the advance of the
      Semites; in fact, the final triumph of the Semites in
      Babylonia was only effected by their amalgamation
      with the old population of the country, and their
      complete acceptance of Accadian culture. The Accadian
      language lingered long, and when it died out was preserved
      as a learned language, like Latin in our own day,
      which every educated Babylonian was expected to know.</p>

  <p>It was natural, therefore, that the pure-blooded

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>

      Semites of Assyria and the mixed population of Babylonia
      should differ from one another in many respects.
      The Babylonians were agriculturists, fond of literature
      and peaceful pursuits. The Assyrians, on the contrary,
      have been appropriately termed the Romans of the
      East: they were a military people, caring for little else
      save war and trade. Their literature, like their culture
      and art, was borrowed from Babylonia, and they never
      took kindly to it. Even under the magnificent patronage
      of Assur-bani-pal, Assyrian literature was an
      exotic. It was cultivated only by the few; whereas in
      Babylonia the greater part of the population seems to
      have been able to read and write. If the Assyrian was
      less luxurious than his Babylonian neighbour, he was
      also less humane. Indeed, the Assyrian annals glory in
      the record of a ferocity at which we stand aghast. On
      the other hand, the Assyrian was not so superstitious as
      the Babylonian, though he ascribed his successes to the
      favour of Assur, and impaled the inhabitants of conquered
      towns or burnt them alive because they did not
      believe in his national deity. He was, as Nahum
      declared, the lion which 'did tear in pieces enough for
      his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled
      his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.'</p>

  <p>Assyria was so wholly a military power, that the
      destruction of Nineveh not only destroyed the Assyrian
      Empire but blotted out the Assyrian nation itself.
      When 'the gates of the rivers' of Nineveh—the Tigris
      and Khusur—were opened, and 'the palace dissolved,'

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

      Assyria ceased to exist. In the Sassanian period the
      mounds which covered the ruins of the old city were for
      a short time occupied by the houses of a village, but
      these, too, disappeared after a while, and the very site
      of Nineveh remained for centuries unknown. Rich, in
      1818, conjectured that the mounds of Kouyunjik, opposite
      the modern town of Mosul, concealed its ruins
      beneath them, but it was not until the excavations of
      the Frenchman Botta, in 1842, and the Englishman
      Layard, in 1845, that the remains first of Dur-Sargon,
      and then of Nineveh itself, were revealed to the eyes of
      a wondering world. The capital of the Assyrian Empire
      was recovered, and with it the sculptured monuments of
      its kings, and the relics of its clay-inscribed library.
      The discovery came at an opportune moment. The
      cuneiform inscriptions of Persia had at last yielded up
      their secrets to the patient sagacity of European
      scholars, and had furnished the key to other
      inscriptions,—also in cuneiform
      characters, but of a wholly different
      kind, and expressing a wholly different language—which
      now proved to be the long-lost records of the Assyrian
      people. Little by little the records were deciphered;
      fresh expeditions to the buried cities of Assyria and
      Babylonia returned to Europe with fresh spoils, and it
      is now possible to describe the history and even the
      daily life and thoughts of a people who but half a
      century ago were but a mere name. The following
      pages are intended to give a picture of that history and
      life.</p>

  <h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h3>
  <h3><span class="smcap">Assyrian History</span></h3>

  <p>Assyrian history, as we have seen, begins with the
      <em>patesis</em> or viceroys of the city of Assur.
      We know little
      about them except their names; contemporaneous annals
      do not commence until Assyria has ceased to be the
      dependency of a foreign power, and has become an
      independent kingdom. It was in the 17th or 16th century
      before the Christian era that Bel-kapkapi first gave
      himself the title of king. For two or three centuries
      afterwards our chief information about the monarchy he
      founded is derived from the relations, sometimes hostile
      and sometimes peaceable, which his successors had with
      Babylonia. One of them, however, Rimmon-nirari I by
      name (about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1320),
      has left us an inscription in which he recounts
      the wars he waged against the Babylonians,
      the Kurds, the Aram&aelig;ans, and the Shuites,
      nomad tribes who extended along the western bank of
      the Euphrates. It was his son, Shalmaneser I, to whom
      the foundation of Calah is ascribed. For six generations
      his descendants followed one another on the throne;
      then came Tiglath-Pileser I, who may be regarded as

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>

      the founder of the first Assyrian Empire. He carried his
      arms as far as Cilicia and Malatiyeh on the west, and
      the wild tribes of Kurdistan on the east; he overthrew
      the Moschi or Meshech, defeated the Hittites and their
      Colchian allies, and erected a memorial of his conquests
      at the sources of the Tigris. The Hittite city of Pethor,
      at the junction of the Euphrates and Sajur, was garrisoned
      with Assyrian soldiers, and at Arvad the Assyrian
      monarch symbolised his subjection of the Mediterranean
      by embarking in a ship and killing a dolphin
      in the sea. In Nineveh he established a botanical
      garden, which he filled with the strange trees he had
      brought back with him from his campaigns. In
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1130
      he marched into Babylonia, and, after a momentary
      repulse at the hands of the Babylonian king, defeated
      his antagonists on the banks of the Lower Zab. Babylonia
      was ravaged, and Babylon itself was captured.</p>

  <p>With the death of Tiglath-Pileser I, Assyrian history
      becomes for awhile obscure. The sceptre fell into feeble
      hands, and the distant conquests of the empire were
      lost. It was during this period of abeyance that the
      kingdom of David and Solomon arose in the west. The
      Assyrian power did not revive until the reign of
      Assur-d&acirc;n II, whose son, Rimmon-nirari II
      (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 911-889),
      and great-grandson, Assur-natsir-pal (
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 883-858), led
      their desolating armies through Western Asia, and
      made the name of Assyria once more terrible to the
      nations around them. Assur-natsir-pal was at once
      one of the most ferocious and most energetic of the

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>

      Assyrian kings. His track was marked by impalements,
      by pyramids of human heads, and by other barbarities
      too horrible to be described. But his campaigns reached
      further than those of Tiglath-Pileser had done. Armenia,
      Mesopotamia, and Kurdistan, were overrun again and
      again; the Babylonians were forced to sue for peace;
      Sangara, the Hittite king of Carchemish, paid tribute,
      and the rich cities of Phœnicia poured their offerings
      into the treasury of Nineveh. The armies of Assyria
      penetrated even to Nizir, where the ark of the Chald&aelig;an
      Noah was believed to have rested on the peak of
      Rowandiz. In Assyria itself the cities were embellished
      with the spoils of foreign conquest; splendid palaces
      were erected, and Calah, which had fallen into decay,
      was restored. A library was erected there, and it
      became the favourite residence of Assur-natsir-pal.</p>

  <p>He was succeeded by his son Shalmaneser II, so
      named, perhaps, after the original founder of Calah.
      Shalmaneser's military successes exceeded even those of
      his father, and his long reign of thirty-five years marks
      the climax of the first Assyrian Empire. His annals are
      chiefly to be found engraved on three monuments now
      in the British Museum. One of these is a monolith
      from Kurkh, a place about twenty miles from Diarbekr.
      The full-length figure of Shalmaneser is sculptured upon
      it, and the surface of the stone is covered with the
      inscription. Another monument is a small 'obelisk'
      of polished black stone, the upper part of which is
      shaped like three ascending steps. Inscriptions run

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>

      round its four sides, as well as small bas-reliefs
      representing the tribute offered to 'the great king' by
      foreign states. Among the tribute-bearers are the
      Israelitish subjects of 'Jehu, son of Omri.' The third
      monument is one which was discovered in 1878 at
      Balaw&acirc;t, about nine miles from Nimr&ucirc;d or Calah.
      It consists of the bronze framework of two colossal doors,
      of rectangular shape, twenty-two feet high and twenty-six
      feet broad. The doors opened into a temple, and
      were made of wood, to which the bronze was fastened
      by means of nails. The bronze was cut into bands,
      which ran in a horizontal direction across the doors, and
      were each divided into two lines of embossed reliefs.
      These reliefs were hammered out, and not cast, and the
      rudeness of their execution proves that they were the
      work of native artists, and not of the Phœnician settlers
      in Nineveh, of whose skill in such work we have several
      specimens. Short texts are added to explain the reliefs,
      so that the various campaigns and cities represented in
      them can all be identified. Among the cities is the
      Hittite capital Carchemish, and the warriors of Armenia
      are depicted in a costume strikingly similar to that of
      the ancient Greeks.</p>

  <p>Shalmaneser's first campaign was against the restless
      tribes of Kurdistan. He then turned northward, and
      fell upon the Armenian king of Van and the Mann&acirc; or
      Minni (see Jer. li. 27), who inhabited the country between
      the mountains of Kot&ucirc;r and Lake Urumiyeh. The
      Hittites of Carchemish, with their allies from Cilicia and

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>

      other neighbouring districts, were next compelled to sue
      for peace, and the acquisition of Pethor, which had been
      lost after Tiglath-Pileser's death, again gave the
      Assyrians the command of the ford over the Euphrates.
      The result of this was, that in
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 854 Shalmaneser
      came into conflict with the kingdom of Hamath. The
      common danger had roused Hadadezer of Damascus,
      called Benhaded II in the Bible, to make common cause
      with Hamath, and a confederacy was formed to resist
      the Assyrian advance. Among the confederates 'Ahab
      of Israel' is mentioned as furnishing the allies with
      2,000 chariots and 10,000 infantry. But the confederacy
      was shattered at Karkar or Aroer, although Shalmaneser
      had himself suffered too severely to be able to follow up
      his victory. For a time, therefore, Syria remained
      unmolested, and the Assyrian king turned his attention to
      Babylonia, which he reduced to a state of vassalage,
      under the pretext of assisting the Babylonian sovereign
      against his rebel brother.</p>

  <p>Twelve years, however, after the battle of Karkar,
      Shalmaneser was once more in the west. Hadadezer
      had been succeeded by Hazael on the throne of Damascus,
      and it was against him that the full flood of Assyrian
      power was turned. For some time he managed to stem
      it, but in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 841
      he suffered a crushing defeat on the
      heights of Shenir (see Deut. iii. 9), and his camp, along
      with 1,121 chariots and 470 carriages, fell into the hands
      of the Assyrians, who proceeded to besiege him in his
      capital, Damascus. The siege, however, was soon raised,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>

      and Shalmaneser contented himself with ravaging the
      Hauran and marching to Beyrout, where his image was
      carved on the rocky promontory of Baal-rosh, at the
      mouth of the Nahr el-Kelb. It was while he was in
      this neighbourhood that the ambassadors of Jehu arrived
      with offers of tribute and submission. The tribute, we
      are told, consisted of 'silver, gold, a golden bowl, vessels
      of gold, goblets of gold, pitchers of gold, a sceptre for
      the king's hand and spear-handles,' and Jehu is erroneously
      entitled 'the son of Omri.'</p>

  <p>After the defeat of Hazael Shalmaneser's expeditions
      were only to distant regions like Phœnicia, Kappadokia,
      and Armenia, for the sake of exacting tribute. No
      further attempt was made at permanent conquest, and
      after <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 834 the old king
      ceased to lead his armies in
      person, the tartan or commander-in-chief taking his
      place. Not long afterwards a revolt broke out headed
      by his eldest son, who seems to have thought that he
      would have little difficulty in wresting the sceptre from
      the hands of the enfeebled king. Twenty-seven cities,
      including Nineveh and Assur, joined the revolt, which
      was, however, finally put down by the energy and
      military capacity of Shalmaneser's second son
      Samas-Rimmon, who succeeded him soon afterwards
      (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
      823-810). On his death he was followed by his son
      Rimmon-nirari III (810-781), who compelled Mariha
      of Damascus to pay him tribute, as well as the
      Phœnicians, Israelites, Edomites, and Philistines. But
      the vigour of the dynasty was beginning to fail. A few

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>

      short reigns followed that of Rimmon-nirari, during
      which the first Assyrian Empire melted away. A
      formidable power arose in Armenia, the Assyrian armies
      were driven to the frontiers of their own country, and
      disaffection began to prevail in Assyria itself. At
      length, on the 15th of June,
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 763, an eclipse of the
      sun took place, and the city of Assur rose in revolt.
      The revolt lasted three years, and before it could be
      crushed the outlying provinces were lost. When
      Assur-nirari, the last of his line, ascended the throne
      in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 753, the empire
      was already gone, and the
      Assyrian cities themselves were surging with discontent.
      Ten years later the final blow was struck; the army
      declared itself against their monarch, and he and his
      dynasty fell together. On the 30th of Iyyar of the year
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 745, a military
      adventurer, Pul, seized
      the vacant crown, and assumed the venerable name of
      Tiglath-Pileser.</p>

  <p>If we may believe Greek tradition, Tiglath-Pileser II
      began life as a gardener. Whatever might have been
      his origin, however, he proved to be a capable
      ruler, a good general, and a far-sighted administrator.
      He was the founder of the second Assyrian Empire,
      which differed essentially from the first. The first
      empire was at best a loosely-connected military
      organization; campaigns were made into distant
      countries for the sake of plunder and tribute, but little
      effort was made to retain the districts that had been
      conquered. Almost as soon as the Assyrian armies

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>

      were out of sight, the conquered nations shook off the
      Assyrian yoke, and it was only in regions bordering on
      Assyria that garrisons were left by the Assyrian king.
      And whenever the Assyrian throne was occupied by
      a weak or unwarlike prince, even these were soon
      destroyed or forced to retreat homewards. Tiglath-Pileser II,
      however, consolidated and organised the
      conquests he made; turbulent populations were deported
      from their old homes, and the empire was divided
      into satrapies or provinces, each of which paid a fixed
      annual tribute to the imperial exchequer. For the
      first time in history the principle of centralisation was
      carried out on a large scale, and a bureaucracy began
      to take the place of the old feudal nobility of Assyria.
      But the second Assyrian Empire was not only an
      organised and bureaucratic one, it was also commercial.
      In carrying out his schemes of conquest Tiglath-Pileser II
      was influenced by considerations of trade.
      His chief object was to divert the commerce of Western
      Asia into Assyrian hands. For this purpose every
      effort was made to unite Babylonia with Assyria, to
      overthrow the Hittites of Carchemish, who held the
      trade of Asia Minor, as well as the high road to the
      west, and to render Syria and the Phœnician cities
      tributary. The policy inaugurated by Tiglath-Pileser
      was successfully followed up by his successors.</p>

  <p>Babylonia was the first to feel the results of the
      change of dynasty at Nineveh. The northern part of it
      was annexed to Assyria, and secured by a chain of

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>

      fortresses. Tiglath-Pileser now attacked the Kurdish
      tribes, who were constantly harassing the eastern frontier
      of the kingdom, and chastised them severely, the
      Assyrian army forcing its way through the fastnesses
      of the Kurdish mountains into the very heart of Media.
      But Ararat, or Armenia, was still a dangerous neighbour,
      and accordingly Tiglath-Pileser's next campaign was
      against a confederacy of the nations of the north headed
      by Sarduris of Van. The confederacy was utterly
      defeated in Kommag&ecirc;n&ecirc;, 72,950 prisoners falling
      into the hands of the Assyrians, and the way was opened
      into Syria. In <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 742
      the siege of Arpad (now Tel
      Erf&acirc;d) began, and lasted two years. Its fall brought
      with it the submission of Northern Syria, and it was next
      the turn of Hamath to be attacked. Hamath was in
      alliance with Uzziah of Judah, and its king Eniel may
      have been of Jewish extraction. But the alliance
      availed nothing. Hamath was taken by storm, part of
      its population transported to Armenia, and their places
      taken by colonists from distant provinces of the empire,
      while nineteen of the districts belonging to it were
      annexed to Assyria. The kings of Syria now flocked
      to render homage and offer tribute to the Assyrian
      conqueror. Among them we read the names of
      Menahem of Samaria, Rezon of Syria, Hiram of Tyre,
      and Pisiris of Carchemish. This was the occasion when,
      as we learn from 2 Kings xv. 19, Menahem gave a
      thousand talents of silver to the Assyrian king Pul, the
      name under which Tiglath-Pileser continued to be

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>

      known in Babylonia, and, as the Old Testament informs
      us, in Palestine also.</p>

  <p>Three years later Ararat was again invaded. Van,
      the capital, was blockaded, and though it successfully
      resisted the Assyrians, the country was devastated far
      and near for a space of 450 miles. It was long before
      the Armenians recovered from the blow, and for the next
      century they ceased to be formidable to Assyria.
      Tiglath-Pileser's northern frontier was now secure, and
      he therefore gladly seized the opportunity of interfering
      in the affairs of the west which was offered him by
      Ahaz, the Jewish king. Ahaz, whom the Assyrian
      inscriptions call Jehoahaz, had been hard pressed by
      Rezon of Damascus and Pekah of Israel, who had
      combined to overthrow the Davidic dynasty and place
      a vassal prince, 'the son of Tabeal,' on the throne of
      Jerusalem. Ahaz in his extremity called in the aid of
      Tiglath-Pileser, offering him a heavy bribe and
      acknowledging his supremacy. Tiglath-Pileser accordingly
      marched into Syria; Rezon was utterly defeated in
      battle and then besieged in Damascus, to which he had
      escaped. Damascus was closely invested; the trees in
      its neighbourhood were cut down; the districts dependent
      on it were ravaged, and forces were despatched
      to punish the Israelites, Ammonites, Moabites, and
      Philistines, who had been the allies of Rezon, Gilead
      and Abel-beth-maachah being burnt, and the tribes
      beyond the Jordan carried into captivity. The Philistine
      cities were compelled to open their gates; the king of

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>

      Ashkelon committed suicide in order not to fall into
      the hands of the enemy, and Khanun of Gaza fled to
      Egypt. At last in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 732,
      after a siege of two years, Damascus was
      forced by famine to surrender. Rezon
      was slain, Damascus given over to plunder and ruin, and
      its inhabitants transported to Kir. Syria became an
      Assyrian province, and all its princes were summoned to
      do homage to the conqueror, while Tyre was fined 150
      talents of gold, or about &pound;400,000. Among the princes
      who attended the lev&eacute;e or 'durbar' was Ahaz, and it
      was while he was attending it that he saw the altar of
      which he sent a pattern to Urijah the priest (2 Kings
      xvi. 10).</p>

  <p>All that now remained for Tiglath-Pileser to do was
      to reduce Babylonia as he had reduced Syria. In
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 731, accordingly,
      he marched again into Chald&aelig;a. Ukin-ziru,
      the Babylonian king, was slain, Babylon and
      other great cities were taken, and in
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 729,
      under his original name of Pul, Tiglath-Pileser
      assumed the title of
      'king of Sumer (Shinar) and Accad.'</p>

  <p>He lived only two years after this, and died in
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
      727, when the crown was seized by Elul&aelig;os of Tinu,
      who took the name of Shalmaneser IV. Shalmaneser's
      short reign was signalised by an unsuccessful attempt to
      capture Tyre, and by the beginning of a war against the
      kingdom of Israel. But the siege of Samaria was hardly
      commenced when Shalmaneser died, or was murdered,
      in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 722,  and was
      succeeded by another usurper who assumed
      the name of Sargon, one of the most famous of

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>

      the early Babylonian kings. Sargon in his inscriptions
      claims royal descent, but the claim was probably without
      foundation. He proved to be an able general, though
      his inscriptions show that he continued to the last to be
      a rough but energetic soldier who had perhaps risen
      from the ranks.</p>

  <p>Two years after his accession
      (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 720) Samaria was
      taken and placed under an Assyrian governor, 27,280 of
      its leading inhabitants being carried captive to Gozan
      and Media. But Sargon soon found that the task of
      cementing and completing the empire founded by
      Tiglath-Pileser was by no means an easy one. Babylonia
      had broken away from Assyria on the news of
      Shalmaneser's death, and had submitted itself to
      Merodach-Baladan the hereditary chieftain of Beth-Yagina
      in the marshes on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
      The southern portion of Sargon's dominions was
      threatened by the ancient and powerful kingdom of
      Elam; the Kurdish tribes on the east renewed their
      depredations; while the Hittite kingdom of Carchemish
      still remained unsubdued, and the Syrian conquests
      could with difficulty be retained. In fact, a new enemy
      appeared in this part of the empire in the shape of
      Egypt.</p>

  <p>Sargon's first act, therefore, was to drive the Elamites
      back to their own country with considerable loss. He
      was then recalled to the west by the revolt of Hamath,
      where Yahu-bihdi, or Ilu-bihdi, whose name perhaps
      indicates his Jewish parentage, had proclaimed himself

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>

      king, and persuaded Arpad, Damascus, Samaria, and
      other cities to follow his standard. But the revolt was
      of short duration. Hamath was burnt, 4,300 Assyrians
      being sent to occupy its ruins, and Yahu-bihdi was
      flayed alive. Sargon next marched along the sea-coast
      to the cities of the Philistines. There the Egyptian
      army was routed at Raphia, and its ally, Khanun of
      Gaza, taken captive.</p>

  <p>In <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 717 all was ready for
      dealing the final blow at the Hittite power in
      Northern Syria. The rich trading
      city of Carchemish was stormed, its last king, Pisiris,
      fell into the hands of the Assyrians, and his Moschian
      allies were forced to retreat to the north. The plunder
      of Carchemish brought eleven talents and thirty manehs
      of gold and 2,100 talents of silver into the treasury of
      Calah. It was henceforth placed under an Assyrian
      satrap, who thus held in his hands the key of the high
      road and the caravan trade between Eastern and Western
      Asia.</p>

  <p>But Sargon was not allowed to retain possession of
      Carchemish without a struggle. Its Hittite inhabitants
      found avengers in the allied populations of the north, in
      Meshech and Tubal, in Ararat and Minni. The struggle
      lasted for six years, but in the end Sargon prevailed.
      Van submitted, its king Ursa, the leader of the coalition
      against Assyria, committed suicide, Cilicia and the
      Tibareni or Tubal were placed under an Assyrian
      governor, and the city of Malatiyeh was razed to the
      ground. In <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 711,
      Sargon was at length free to

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>

      turn his attention to the west. Here affairs wore a
      threatening aspect. Merodach-Baladan, foreseeing that
      his own turn would come as soon as Sargon had firmly
      established his power in Northern Syria, had despatched
      ambassadors to the Mediterranean states, urging them to
      combine with him against the common foe. We read in
      the Bible of the arrival of the Babylonian embassy in
      Jerusalem, and of the rebuke received by Hezekiah for
      his vainglory in displaying to the strangers the resources
      of his kingdom. In spite of Isaiah's warning, Hezekiah
      listened to the persuasions of the Babylonian envoys,
      and encouraged by the promise of Egyptian support
      along with Phœnicia, Moab, Edom, and the Philistines,
      determined to defy the Assyrian king.</p>

  <p>But before the confederates were ready to act in
      concert Sargon descended upon Palestine. Phœnicia
      and Judah were overrun, Jerusalem was captured, and
      Ashdod burnt, while the Egyptians made no attempt to
      help their friends. This siege of Ashdod is the only
      occasion on which the name of Sargon occurs in the
      Bible (Isaiah xx. 1). As soon as all source of danger
      was removed in the west Sargon hurled his forces
      against Babylonia. Merodach-Baladan had made every
      preparation to meet the coming attack, and the Elamite
      king had engaged to help him. But the Elamites were
      again compelled to fly before the warriors of Assyria,
      and Sargon entered Babylon in triumph
      (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 710).
      The following year he pursued Merodach-Baladan to
      his ancestral stronghold in the marshes; Beth-Yagina

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>

      was taken by storm, and its unfortunate defenders were
      sent in chains to Nineveh. Sargon was now at the
      height of his power. His empire was a compact and
      consolidated whole, reaching from the Mediterranean on
      the west to the mountains of Elam on the east, and his
      solemn coronation at Babylon gave a title to his claim to
      be the legitimate successor of the ancient Sargon of
      Accad. The old kingdoms of Elam and Egypt alone
      remained to threaten the newly-founded empire, which
      received the voluntary homage of the smaller states that
      lay immediately beyond it. Thus the sacred island of
      Dilvun in the Persian Gulf submitted itself to the terrible
      conqueror, and the Phœnicians of Kition or Chittim
      in Cyprus erected a monumental record of his supremacy.</p>

  <p>Sargon's end was consonant with his whole career.
      He was murdered by his soldiers in his new city of
      Dur-Sargon or Khorsabad, on the 12th of Ab or July,
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 705,
      and was succeeded by his son Sennacherib.
      If we may judge from Sennacherib's name, which means
      'the Moon-god has increased the brothers,' he would
      not have been Sargon's eldest son. In any case he had
      been brought up in the purple, and displayed none of the
      rugged virtues of his father. He was weak, boastful, and
      cruel, and preserved his empire only by the help of the
      veterans and generals whom Sargon had trained.</p>

  <p>Merodach-Baladan had escaped from captivity, and
      two years after the death of Sargon had once more
      possessed himself of Babylon. But a battle at Kis

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>

      drove him from the country nine months subsequently,
      and Sennacherib was able to turn his attention to affairs
      in the west. In <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 701,
      he marched into Phœnicia and Palestine, where
      Hezekiah of Judah and some of the
      neighbouring kings had refused their tribute. Tirhakah,
      the Ethiopian king of Egypt, had promised support to
      the rebellious states, and Padi, the king of Ekron, who
      remained faithful to the Assyrians, was carried in chains
      to Jerusalem. The Assyrian army fell first upon
      Phœnicia. Great and Little Sidon, Sarepta, Acre, and
      other towns, surrendered, Elul&aelig;os, the Sidonian
      monarch, fled to Cyprus, and the kings of Arvad and
      Gebal offered homage. Metinti of Ashdod, Pedael of
      Ammon, Chemosh-nadab of Moab, and Melech-ram
      of Edom, also submitted. Then, says Sennacherib:
      'Zedekiah, king of Ashkelon, who had not submitted to
      my yoke, himself, the gods of the house of his fathers,
      his wife, his sons, his daughters, and his brothers, the
      seed of the house of his fathers, I removed, and I sent
      him to Syria. I set over the men of Ashkelon Sarludari,
      the son of Rukipti, their former king, and I imposed
      upon him the payment of tribute, and the homage due
      to my majesty, and he became a vassal. In the course
      of my campaign I approached and captured Beth-Dagon,
      Joppa, Bene-berak, and Azur, the cities of
      Zedekiah, which did not submit at once to my yoke, and
      I carried away their spoil. The priests, the chief men,
      and the common people of Ekron who had thrown into
      chains their king Padi because he was faithful to his

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>

      oaths to Assyria, and had given him up to Hezekiah,
      the Jew, who imprisoned him like an enemy in a dark
      dungeon, feared in their hearts. The king of Egypt, the
      bowmen, the chariots, and the horses of the king of
      Ethiopia, had gathered together innumerable forces, and
      gone to their assistance. In sight of the town of
      Eltekeh was their order of battle drawn up; they called
      their troops (to the battle). Trusting in Assur, my lord,
      I fought with them and overthrew them. My hands
      took the captains of the chariots, and the sons of the king
      of Egypt, as well as the captains of the chariots of the
      king of Ethiopia, alive in the midst of the battle. I
      approached and captured the towns of Eltekeh and
      Timnath, and I carried away their spoil. I marched
      against the city of Ekron, and put to death the priests
      and the chief men who had committed the sin (of
      rebellion), and I hung up their bodies on stakes all
      round the city. The citizens who had done wrong and
      wickedness I counted as a spoil; as for the rest of them
      who had done no sin or crime, in whom no fault was
      found, I proclaimed a free pardon. I had Padi, their
      king, brought out from the midst of Jerusalem, and
      I seated him on the throne of royalty over them, and
      I laid upon him the tribute due to my majesty. But
      as for Hezekiah of Judah, who had not submitted to
      my yoke, forty-six of his strong cities, together with
      innumerable fortresses and small towns which depended
      on them, by overthrowing the walls and open attack, by
      battle engines and battering-rams, I besieged, I captured,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>

      I brought out from the midst of them and counted as a
      spoil 200,150 persons, great and small, male and female,
      horses, mules, asses, camels, oxen and sheep without
      number. Hezekiah himself I shut up like a bird in a
      cage in Jerusalem, his royal city. I built a line of forts
      against him, and I kept back his heel from going forth
      out of the great gate of his city. I cut off his cities that
      I had spoiled from the midst of his land, and gave them
      to Metinti, king of Ashdod, Padi, king of Ekron, and
      Zil-baal, king of Gaza, and I made his country small. In
      addition to their former tribute and yearly gifts, I added
      other tribute, and the homage due to my majesty, and
      I laid it upon them. The fear of the greatness of my
      majesty overwhelmed him, even Hezekiah, and he sent
      after me to Nineveh, my royal city, by way of gift and
      tribute, the Arabs and his body-guard whom he had
      brought for the defence of Jerusalem, his royal city, and
      had furnished with pay, along with thirty talents of
      gold, 800 talents of pure silver, carbuncles and other
      precious stones, a couch of ivory, thrones of ivory, an
      elephant's hide, an elephant's tusk, rare woods of various
      names, a vast treasure, as well as the eunuchs of his
      palace, dancing-men and dancing-women; and he sent
      his ambassador to offer homage.'</p>

  <p>In this account of his campaign Sennacherib discreetly
      says nothing about the disaster which befell his army
      in front of Jerusalem, and which obliged him to return
      ignominiously to Assyria without attempting to capture
      Jerusalem, and to deal with Hezekiah as it was his

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>

      custom to deal with other rebellious kings. The tribute
      offered by Hezekiah at Lachish, when he vainly tried to
      buy off the threatened Assyrian attack, is represented
      as having been the final result of a successful campaign.
      There is, however, no exaggeration in the amount of
      silver Sennacherib claims to have received, since 800
      talents of silver are equivalent to the 500 talents stated by
      the Bible to have been given, when reckoned according to
      the standard of value in use at the time in Nineveh.</p>

  <p>Sennacherib never recovered from the blow he had
      suffered in Judah. He made no more expeditions
      against Palestine, and during the rest of his reign
      Judah remained unmolested. Babylonia, moreover,
      gave him constant trouble. In the year after his
      campaign in the west
      (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 700) a Chaldean, named
      Nergal-yusezib, stirred up a revolt which Sennacherib
      had some difficulty in suppressing. Two years later
      he appointed his eldest son, Assur-nadin-sumi, viceroy
      of Babylon. In <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
      694, he determined to attack the followers of
      Merodach-Baladan in their last retreat at
      the mouth of the Eul&aelig;us, where land had been given
      to them by the Elamite king after their expulsion from
      Babylonia. Ships were built and manned by Phœnicians
      in the Persian Gulf, by means of which the settlements
      of the Chaldean refugees were burnt and destroyed.
      Meanwhile, however, Babylonia itself was invaded by
      the Elamites; the Assyrian viceroy was carried into
      captivity, and Nergal-yusezib placed on the throne of
      the country. He defeated the Assyrian forces in a

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>

      battle near Nipur, but died soon afterwards, and was
      followed by Musezib-Merodach, who like his predecessor
      is called Suzub in Sennacherib's inscriptions.
      He defied the Assyrian power for nearly four years.
      But in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
      690 the combined Babylonian and Elamite army
      was overthrown in the decisive battle of Khalule,
      and before another year was past Sennacherib had
      captured Babylon, and given it up to fire and sword.
      Its inhabitants were sold into slavery, and the waters
      of the Araxes canal allowed to flow over its ruins.
      Sennacherib now assumed the title of king of Babylonia,
      but with the exception of a campaign into the Cilician
      mountains he seems to have undertaken no more
      military expeditions. The latter years of his life were
      passed in constructing canals and aqueducts, in
      embanking the Tigris, and in rebuilding the palace of
      Nineveh on a new and sumptuous scale. On the
      20th of Tebet, or December,
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 681, he
      was murdered by his two elder sons,
      Adrammelech and Nergal-sharezer,
      who were jealous of the favour shown to their younger
      brother, Esar-haddon.</p>

  <p>Esar-haddon was at the time conducting a campaign
      against Erimenas, king of Armenia, to whom his
      insurgent brothers naturally fled. Between seven and
      eight weeks after the murder of the old king, a battle
      was fought near Malatiyeh, in Kappadokia, between
      the veterans of Esar-haddon and the forces under his
      brothers and Erimenas, which ended in the complete
      defeat of the latter. Esar-haddon was proclaimed king,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>

      and the event proved that a wiser choice could not have
      been made.</p>

  <p>His military genius was of the first order, but it was
      equalled by his political tact. He was the only king of
      Assyria who endeavoured to conciliate the nations he
      had conquered. Under him the fabric of the Second
      Empire was completed by the conquest of Egypt. In the
      first year of his reign he rebuilt Babylon, giving it back its
      captured deities, its plunder, and its people. Henceforth
      Babylon became the second capital of the empire, the
      court residing alternately there and at Nineveh. It was
      while Esar-haddon was holding his winter court at
      Babylon that Manasseh, of Judah, was brought to him
      as prisoner.
    <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanch2"
        title="2 Chr. xxxiii. 11.">[1]</a></p>

  <p>The trade of Phœnicia was diverted into Assyrian
      hands by the destruction of Sidon. The caravan-road
      from east to west was at the same time rendered secure
      by an expedition into the heart of Northern Arabia.
      Here Esar-haddon penetrated as far as the lands of
      Huz and Buz, 280 miles of the march being through
      a waterless desert. The feat has never been excelled,
      and the terror it inspired among the Bedouin tribes was
      not forgotten for many years. The northern frontiers
      of the kingdom were also made safe by the defeat of
      Teispes, the Kimmerian, who was driven westward with
      his hordes into Asia Minor. In the east the Assyrian
      monarch was bold enough to occupy and work the
      copper-mines on the distant borders of Media, the very

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>

      name of which had scarcely been heard of before.
      Westward, the kings of Cyprus paid homage to the
      great conqueror, and among the princes who sent
      materials for his palace at Nineveh were Cyprian rulers
      with Greek names.</p>

  <p>But the principal achievement of Esar-haddon's reign
      was his conquest of the ancient monarchy of Egypt.
      In <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 675 the Assyrian
      army started for the banks of the Nile.
      Four years later Memphis was taken on the
      22nd of Tammuz, or June, and Tirhakah, the Egyptian
      king, compelled to fly first to Thebes, and then into
      Ethiopia. Egypt was divided into twenty satrapies,
      governed partly by Assyrians, partly by native princes,
      whose conduct was watched by Assyrian garrisons. On
      his return to Assyria Esar-haddon associated Assur-bani-pal,
      the eldest of his four sons, in the government
      on the 12th of Iyyar, or April,
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 669, and
      died two years afterwards (on the 12th of Marchesvan, or
      October), when again on his way to Egypt. Assur-bani-pal,
      the Sardanapalos of the Greeks, succeeded
      to the empire, his brother, Samas-sum-yukin, being
      entrusted with the government of Babylonia.</p>

  <p>Assur-bani-pal is probably the 'great and noble'
      Asnapper of Ezra iv. 10. He was luxurious, ambitious,
      and cruel, but a munificent patron of literature. The
      libraries of Babylonia were ransacked for ancient texts,
      and scribes were kept busily employed at Nineveh in
      inscribing new editions of older works. But unlike his
      fathers, Assur-bani-pal refused to face the hardships of

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a>
  <a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a>

      a campaign. His armies were led by generals, who were
      required to send despatches from time to time to the
      king. It was evident that a purely military empire, like
      that of Assyria, could not last long, when its ruler had
      himself ceased to take an active part in military affairs.
      At first the veterans of his father preserved and even
      extended the empire of Assur-bani-pal; but before his
      death it was shattered irretrievably. It is characteristic
      of Assur-bani-pal that his lion-hunts were
      mere <em>battues</em>, in which tame animals
      were released from cages and
      lashed to make them run; in curious contrast to the
      lion-hunts in the open field in which his warlike
      predecessors had delighted.</p>

  <p>His first occupation was to crush a revolt in Egypt.
      Tirhakah was once more driven out of the country, and
      Thebes, called Ni in the Assyrian texts, and No-Amon,
      or 'No of the god Amun' in Scripture, was plundered
      and destroyed. Its temples were hewed in pieces, and
      two of its obelisks, weighing 70 tons in all, were carried
      as trophies to Nineveh. It is to this destruction of the
      old capital of the Pharaohs that Nahum refers in his
      prophecy (iii. 8).</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Tyre had been besieged and forced to
      surrender, and Cilicia had paid homage to the Assyrian
      king. Gog, or Gyges, of Lydia, too, voluntarily sent
      him tribute, including two Kimmerian chieftains whom
      the Lydian sovereign had captured in battle. When
      the Lydian ambassadors arrived in Nineveh they found
      no one who could understand their language; in fact,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>

      the very name of Lydia had been unknown to the
      Assyrians before.</p>

  <p>The Assyrian Empire had now reached its widest
      limits. Elam had fallen after a long and arduous
      struggle. Shushan, its capital, was razed to the ground,
      and the three last Elamite kings were bound to the yoke
      of Assur-bani-pal's chariot, and made to drag their
      conqueror through the streets of Nineveh. The Kedarites
      and other nomad tribes of Northern Arabia were also
      chastised, the land of the Minni was overrun, and the
      Armenians of Van begged for an alliance with the
      Assyrian king.</p>

  <p>But while at the very height of his prosperity, the
      empire was fast slipping away from under Assur-bani-pal's
      feet. In <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
      652 a rebellion broke out headed by his brother,
      the Babylonian viceroy, which shook it
      to the foundations. Babylonia, Egypt, Palestine, and
      Arabia made common cause against the oppressor.
      Lydia sent Karian and Ionic mercenaries to Psammetikhos
      of Sais, with whose help he succeeded in overthrowing
      his brother satraps, and in delivering Egypt
      from the Assyrian yoke. The revolt in Babylonia took
      long to quell, and for a time the safety of Assur-bani-pal
      himself was imperilled. At last in 647 Babylon and
      Cuthah were reduced by famine, and Samas-sum-yukin
      burnt himself to death in his palace. Fire and sword
      were carried through Elam, and the last of its monarchs
      became an outlawed fugitive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

  <p>When Assyria finally emerged from the deadly
      struggle, Egypt was lost to it for ever, and Babylonia
      was but half subdued. The latter province was placed
      under the government of Kandalanu, who ruled over it
      for twenty-two years, more like an independent sovereign
      than a viceroy. His successor, Nabopolassar, the father
      of Nebuchadnezzar, threw off all semblance of submission
      to Nineveh, and prepared the way for the empire
      of his son. But meanwhile the once proud kingdom
      of Assyria had been contending for bare existence.
      Assur-bani-pal's son, Assur-etil-ilani, rebuilt with
      diminished splendour the palace of Calah, which seems to
      have been burnt by some victorious enemy; and when
      the last Assyrian king, Esar-haddon II, called Sarakos
      by the Greeks, mounted the throne, he found himself
      surrounded on all sides by threatening foes. Kaztarit or
      Kyaxares, Mamitarsu the Median, the Kimmerians, the
      Minni, and the people of Sepharad leagued themselves
      together against the devoted city of Nineveh. The
      frontier towns fell first, and though Esar-haddon in
      his despair proclaimed public fasts and prayers to the
      gods, nothing could ward off the doom pronounced by
      God's prophets against Nineveh so long before.
      Nineveh was besieged, captured, and utterly destroyed;
      and the second Assyrian Empire perished more hopelessly
      and completely than the first. All that survived
      was the old capital of the country, Assur, whose former
      inhabitants were allowed to return to it by Cyrus at the

<span class="pagenum">

      time when the Jewish exiles also were released from
      their captivity in Babylon.

  <h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h3>
  <h3><span class="smcap">Assyrian Religion</span></h3>


  <p>The Assyrians derived the greater part of their deities
      and religious beliefs, like their literature and culture
      generally, from Babylonia. The Babylonian gods were
      the gods of Assyria also. Most of them were of
      Accadian or pr&aelig;-Semitic origin, but the Semitic
      Babylonians, when they appropriated the civilisation of the
      Accadians, modified them in accordance with their own
      conceptions. The Accadians believed that every object and
      phenomenon of nature had its <em>Zi</em> or 'spirit,' some
      of them beneficent, others hostile to man, like the objects
      and phenomena they represented. Naturally, however,
      there were more malevolent than beneficent spirits in the
      universe, and there was scarcely an action which did not
      risk demoniac possession. Diseases were due to the
      malevolence of these spirits, and could be cured only by
      the use of certain charms and exorcisms. Exorcisms, in
      fact, gave those who employed them power over the
      spirits; they could by means of them compel the evil
      spirit to retire, and the beneficent spirit to approach.
      The knowledge of such exorcisms was in the hands of
      the priests, so that priest and magician were almost
      synonymous terms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">
    <a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

  <p>Among the multitude of spirits feared by the
      Accadians, there were some which had been raised
      above the rest into the position of gods. Of these, Anu,
      'the sky;' Mul-ge, 'the earth;' and Ea, 'the deep,'
      were the most conspicuous. At their side stood the
      'spirits' of the heavenly bodies—the Moon-god, the
      Sun-god, the evening star, and the other planets. The
      Moon-god ranked before the Sun-god, as might indeed
      have been expected to be the case among a nation of
      astronomers like the Chaldeans.</p>

  <p>When the Semitic Babylonians adopted the deities of
      their predecessors and teachers, Anu and his compeers
      lost much of their elemental nature, while the Sun-god
      Samas came to assume an important place. The religion
      of the Babylonian Semites, in fact, was essentially solar;
      the Sun-god was addressed as Bel or Baal, the supreme
      'lord,' and adored under various forms. He appeared
      to them, moreover, under two aspects, sometimes as the
      kindly deity who gives life and light to all things,
      sometimes as the scorching sun of summer who
      demanded the sacrifice of the first-born to appease his
      wrath. Sometimes, again, he was worshipped as the
      young and beautiful Tammuz, slain by the boar's tusk
      of winter; whose death was lamented at the autumnal
      equinox, and who was invoked as <em>adoni</em>
      (<em>Adonis</em>) or 'master.'</p>

  <p>Unlike the Accadians, who did not distinguish
      gender, the Semites divided all nouns into masculines
      and feminines. By the side of the god, consequently,

<span class="pagenum">
`<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>

      stood the goddess. She was, however, but a pale
      reflection of her male consort, created, so to speak, by
      the necessities of grammar. She had no independent
      attributes of her own; Beltis, or Bilat, the wife of Bel,
      was nothing more than the feminine complement of the
      god. The Accadians had known of one great goddess,
      Istar, the evening star; but Istar was an independent
      deity, with attributes as strongly and individually
      marked as those of the gods. Among the Semites,
      Istar became Ashtoreth, with the feminine suffix <em>th</em>,
      and though in Babylonia the old legends and traditions
      prevented her from losing altogether her primitive
      character, she tended more and more to pass into the
      mere reflection of some male deity. Just as the gods
      could be collectively spoken of as Baalim or 'lords,' all
      being regarded as so many different forms of the Sun-god,
      the goddesses also were termed Ashtaroth or
      'Ashtoreths.'</p>

  <p>We see, therefore, that in adopting the pantheon of
      Accad, the Semites made three important changes. The
      Sun-god was assigned a leading place in worship and
      belief; female deities were introduced, who were, however,
      mere reflections of the gods; while the inferior
      deities of the Accadians were classed among 'the 300
      spirits of heaven' and 'the 600 spirits of earth,' only a
      few of the more prominent ones retaining their old
      position. These latter may be grouped as follows:—</p>

  <p>At the head of the divine hierarchy still stood the old
      triad of Anu, Mul-ge, and Ea. Mul-ge's name, however,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>

      was changed to Bel, but since Merodach was also known
      as Bel, he fell more and more into the background,
      especially after the rise of Babylon, of which city
      Merodach was the patron deity. At Nipur, now Niffer,
      alone, he continued to be worshipped down into late
      times. His consort was Bilat, or Beltis, 'the great lady,'
      who eventually came to be regarded as the wife of
      Merodach rather than of 'the other Bel.' Like Anu and
      Ea, Bel was the offspring of Sar and Kisar, the upper
      and lower firmaments.</p>

  <p>Anu was the visible sky, but he also represented the
      invisible heaven, which was supposed to extend above
      the visible one, and to be the abode of the gods. The
      chief seat of his worship was Erech, where he was
      regarded as the oldest of the gods, and the original
      creator of the universe. But elsewhere, also, he was
      looked upon as the creator of the visible world, and the
      father of the gods. By his side, in the Semitic period,
      stood the goddess Anat, whose attributes were derived
      from his. The worship of Anat spread from Babylonia
      to the Canaanites, as is shown by the geographical
      names Beth Anath, 'the temple of Anat' (Josh. xix. 38;
      xv. 59), and Anathoth, the city of 'the goddesses Anat.'
      It was even introduced into Egypt after the Asiatic
      wars of the eighteenth dynasty. In the pr&aelig;-Semitic days
      of Chaldea, a monotheistic school had flourished, which
      resolved the various deities of the Accadian belief into
      manifestations of the one supreme god, Anu; and old
      hymns exist in which reference is made to 'the one

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>

      god.' But this school never seems to have numbered
      many adherents, and it eventually died out. Its existence,
      however, reminds us of the fact that Abraham was
      born in 'Ur of the Chaldees.'</p>

  <p>Ea originally represented the ocean-stream or 'great
      deep,' which was supposed to surround the earth like a
      serpent, and by which all rivers and springs were fed.
      He was symbolised by the snake, and was held to be
      the creator and benefactor of mankind. One of his
      most frequent titles is 'lord of wisdom,' and the chief
      seat of his worship was at Eridu, 'the holy city,' near
      which was the sacred grove or 'garden,' the centre of the
      world, where the tree of life and knowledge had its roots.
      It was Ea who had given to mankind not only life, but
      all the arts and appliances of culture also, and it was his
      help that the Babylonian invoked when in trouble. He
      was emphatically the god of healing, who had revealed
      medicines to mankind. As god of the great deep, he
      was often figured as a man with the tail of a fish, and in
      this form was known to the Greeks under the name of
      Oannes or 'Ea the fish.' Sometimes the skin of a fish
      was suspended behind his back. Oannes, it was said,
      had in early days ascended out of the Persian Gulf, and
      taught the first inhabitants of Babylonia letters, science,
      and art, besides writing a history of the origin of mankind
      and their different ways of life. His wife was
      Dav-kina, 'the lady of the earth,' who presided over
      the lower world.</p>

  <p>Among the numerous offspring of Ea and Dav-kina,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>

      Merodach held the foremost place. He was originally a
      form of the Sun-god, regarded under his beneficent
      aspect, and was believed to be ever engaged in combating
      the powers of evil, and in performing services for mankind.
      Hence he is addressed as 'the redeemer of
      mankind,' 'the restorer to life,' and the 'raiser from the
      dead,' and a considerable number of the religious hymns
      are dedicated to him. He was believed to be continually
      passing backwards and forwards between the earth and
      the heaven where Ea dwelt, informing Ea of the sufferings
      of men, and returning with Ea's directions how to
      relieve them. One of the bas-reliefs from Nineveh, now
      in the British Museum, represents him as pursuing with
      his curved sword or thunderbolt the demon Tiamat, the
      personification of chaos and anarchy, who is depicted
      with claws, tail, and horns. As we have already seen,
      he was commonly addressed as Bel or 'lord,' and so
      came gradually to supplant the older Bel or Mul-ge.
      Among the planets his star was Jupiter. His wife was
      Zarpanit or Zirat-panitu, in whom some scholars have
      seen the Succoth-benoth of 2 Kings xvii. 30.</p>

  <p>The children of Merodach and Zarpanit were Nebo,
      'the prophet,' and his wife Tasmit, 'the hearer.' Nebo
      was the god of oratory and literature; it was he who
      'enlightened the eyes' to understand written characters,
      while his wife 'enlarged the ears,' so that they could
      comprehend what was read. The origin of the cuneiform
      system of writing was ascribed to Nebo. To him was
      dedicated 'the temple of the Seven Lights of Heaven

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>

      and Earth,' at Borsippa, the suburb of Babylon, which is
      now known to the Arabs as the Birs-i-Nimr&ucirc;d, and his
      worship was carried as far as Canaan, as we may gather
      from such names as the city of Nebo, in Jud&aelig;a (Ezra ii.
      29), and Mount Nebo, in Moab (Deut. xxxii. 49). In
      Accadian he had been called Dimsar, 'the tablet-writer,'
      and a temple was erected to him in the island of
      Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf, where he was worshipped
      under the name of Enzak. As a planetary deity, he was
      identified with Mercury. He was often adored under
      the name of Nusku, although Nusku had originally been
      a separate divinity, and the same, perhaps, as the
      Nisroch of the Bible (2 Kings xix. 37).</p>

  <p>The companion of Merodach was Rimmon, or rather
      Ramman, 'the thunderer.' He represented the atmosphere,
      and was accordingly the god of rain and storm,
      who was armed with the lightning and the thunderbolt.
      Sometimes he was dreaded as 'the destroyer of crops,'
      'the scatterer of the harvest;' at other times prayers
      were made to him as 'the lord of fecundity.' His
      worship extended into Syria, where Rimmon appears to
      have been the supreme deity of Damascus, and where he
      was also known under the name of Hadad or Dadda.</p>

  <p>Two other elemental gods were Samas, the Sun-god,
      and Sin, the Moon-god. Samas was the son of Sin, in
      accordance with the astronomical view of the old
      Babylonians, which made the moon the measurer of
      time, and regarded the day as the offspring of night.
      Samas, however, like Saul or Savul, another deity of

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>

      whom mention is made in the inscriptions, was really
      but a form of Merodach, though in historical times the
      two divinities were separated from one another, and
      received different cults. Samas, again, was originally
      identical with Tammuz; but when Tammuz came to
      denote only the sun of spring and summer, while the
      myth that associated him with Istar laid firm hold
      of men's minds, Tammuz assumed separate attributes,
      and an individual existence apart from Samas.</p>

  <p>Sin, the Moon-god, was termed Agu or Acu by the
      Accadians, and if the name of Mount Sinai was derived
      from him, as is sometimes supposed, we should have
      evidence that he was known and worshipped in Northern
      Arabia. At all events he was one of the deities of
      Southern Arabia. Sin was the patron-god of the city of
      Ur, and it was to him that the Assyrian kings traced
      the formation of their kingdom. One of the most famous
      of his temples was in the ancient city of Harran, where
      he was symbolised by an upright cone of stone. As the
      emblem of the Sun-god was the solar orb, the emblem
      of Sin was the crescent moon.</p>

  <p>According to some of the legends of Babylonia, the
      daughter of the Moon-god was the goddess Istar. Other
      legends, however, placed Istar among the older gods,
      and made her the daughter of Anu, the sky. In either
      case she was at the outset the goddess of the evening
      star, and when it was discovered that the evening and
      morning stars were the same, of the morning star also.
      As the evening star, she was known as Istar of Erech, as

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>

      the morning star, she was identified with Anunit or
      Anat, the goddess of Accad. At times she was also
      regarded as androgynous, both male and female.</p>

  <p>Istar was the chief of the Accadian goddesses, and she
      retained her rank even among the Semites, who, as we
      have seen, looked upon the goddess as the mere consort
      and shadow of the god. But Istar continued to the last
      a separate and independent divinity. She presided over
      love and war, as well as over the chase. She was
      invoked as 'the queen of heaven,' 'the queen of all the
      gods,' and there was often a tendency to merge in her
      the other goddesses of the pantheon. Her principal
      temples were at Erech, Nineveh, and Arbela, but altars
      were erected to her in almost every place, and she was
      adored under as many forms and titles as she possessed
      shrines. Her name and worship spread through the
      Semitic world, in Southern Arabia, in Syria, in Moab,
      where she was identified with the Sun-god, Chemosh,
      and in Canaan, where she was called Ashtoreth, the
      Astart&ecirc; of the Greeks. But the Greeks also knew her as
      Aphrodit&ecirc;, the goddess whom they had borrowed from
      the Phœnicians of Canaan, and we may discover her
      again in the Ephesian Artemis. The rites performed in
      her temples made Istar or Ashtoreth the darkest blot
      in Assyrian and Canaanitish religion, and excited the
      utmost horror and indignation of the prophets of God.
      When the moon came to be conceived as a female
      divinity, the pale reflection, as it were, of the sun, Istar,
      the evening star, became also the goddess of the moon.

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>

      Hence it is that 'the queen of heaven' (Jer. xliv. 17)
      passed into Astart&ecirc; 'with crescent horns.'</p>

      <p>One of the most popular of old Babylonian myths told
      how Istar had wedded the young and beautiful Sun-god,
      Tammuz, 'the only-begotten,' and had descended into
      Hades in search of him when he had been slain by the
      boar's tusk of winter. A portion of a Babylonian poem
      has been preserved to us, which describes her passage
      through the seven gates of the underworld, where she
      left with the warden of each some one of her adornments,
      until at last she reached the seat of the infernal goddess
      Allat, stripped and bare. There she remained imprisoned
      until the gods, wearied of the long absence of the goddess
      of love, created a hound called 'the renewal of light,'
      who restored her to the upper world. The myth clearly
      refers to the waning and waxing of the monthly moon,
      and must therefore have originated when Istar had
      already become the goddess of the moon. The myth
      entered deeply into the religious belief of the worshippers
      of Istar. The Accadians called the month of August
      'the month of the errand of Istar,' while June was
      termed 'the month of Tammuz' by the Semites. It was
      then that, as Milton writes, his</p>

  <p>But it was not only in Assyria and Phœnicia that the
      death of Tammuz was lamented by the women year by
      year. The infection spread to Judah also, and even in
      Jerusalem, within the precincts of the temple itself,
      Ezekiel saw 'women weeping for Tammuz' (Ezek.
      viii. 14).</p>

  <p>There are only two other Assyro-Babylonian deities
      who need be mentioned, Nergal and Adar. Nergal was
      the presiding deity of Cuthah and its vast necropolis.

        title="Confer 2 Kings xvii. 30.">[3]</a>
      He shared with Anu the privilege of superintending the
      regions of the dead, and he was also a god of hunting
      and war. His name, like those of Anu, Ea, and Istar,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>

      was of Accadian origin. Adar, the son of Beltis, was one
      of those solar deities who were formed by worshipping
      the Sun-god under some particular attribute. The
      reading of his name is, unfortunately, not certain, and
      Adar is only its most probable pronunciation. If it is
      correct, Adar will be the deity meant in 2 Kings xvii.
      31, where it is stated that the people of Sepharvaim, or
      the two Sipparas, burnt their children in fire to
      Adrammelech and Anammelech, that is to say, to
      'King Adar' and 'King Anu.'</p>

  <p>Such were the principal divinities of Babylonia and
      Assyria. But the Assyrians had another also, whom
      they exalted above all the rest. This was Assur, the
      divine impersonation of the state and empire. It was
      Assur who, according to the Assyrian kings, led them to
      victory, and the cruelties they practised on the conquered
      were, they held, judgments exercised against those who
      would not believe in him. Assur, in the form of an
      archer, is sometimes represented on the monuments in
      the midst of the winged solar disk, and above the head
      of the monarch, whom he protects from his enemies.</p>

  <p>The Assyrian, however, was not so pious or superstitious
      as his Babylonian neighbour. The Babylonian lived
      in perpetual dread of the evil spirits which thronged
      about him; almost every moment had its religious
      ceremony, almost every action its religious complement.
      Not only had the State ritual to be attended to; the
      unceasing attacks of the demons could be warded off
      only by magical incantations and the intervention of the

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>

      sorcerer-priest. But the Assyrians were too much
      occupied with wars and fighting to give all this heed to
      the requirements of religion. It is significant that,
      whereas in Babylonia we find the remains of scarcely
      any great buildings except temples, the great buildings
      of Assyria were the royal palaces. The libraries, which
      in Babylonia were stored in the temples, were deposited
      in Assyria in the palace of the king.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the greater part of the religious system
      of Babylonia had been transported into Assyria. Along
      with the Babylonian deities had come the Babylonian
      scriptures. These were divided into two great collections
      or volumes. The first, and oldest, was a collection of
      exorcisms and magical texts, by the use of which, it was
      believed, the spirits of evil could be driven away, and the
      spirits of good induced to visit the reciter. When,
      however, certain independent deities began to emerge
      from among the multitudinous 'spirits' of the primitive
      Accadian creed, hymns were composed in their honour,
      and these hymns were eventually collected together,
      and, like the Rig-Veda of India, became a second sacred
      book. After the Accadians had been supplanted by the
      Semites, the Accadian language, in which the hymns
      were originally written, was provided with a Semitic
      translation; but it was still considered necessary to recite
      the exact words of the original, since the words themselves
      were sacred, and any mistake in their pronunciation
      would invalidate the religious service in which they were
      employed. Some of the incantations embodied in the

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>

      collection of exorcisms must have been introduced into
      it subsequently to the compilation of the sacred hymns,
      since the latter are found inserted in them. From this
      it would appear that the older collection continued to
      receive additions for a long while after the younger
      collection—that of the sacred hymns—had been put
      together and invested with a sacred character. This
      could not have been till after the beginning of the
      Semitic period, since there are a few hymns which
      do not seem to have had any Accadian originals. If
      we may compare the two collections with our own
      religious literature, we may say that the collection of
      hymns corresponded more to our Bible, that of exorcisms
      to our Prayer Book.</p>

  <p>The Babylonians and Assyrians, however, possessed a
      liturgy which answered far better to our conception of
      what a Prayer Book should be. This contained services
      for particular days and hours, together with rubrics for
      the direction of the priest. Thus we are told that 'in
      the month Nisan, on the second day, two hours after
      nightfall, the priest [of Bel at Babylon] must come and
      take of the waters of the river, must enter into the
      presence of Bel, and change his dress; must put on
      a robe in the presence of Bel, and say this prayer: "O
      my lord who in his strength has no equal, O my lord,
      blessed sovereign, lord of the world, speeding the peace
      of the great gods, the lord who in his might destroys
      the strong, lord of kings, light of mankind, establisher
      of trust, O Bel, thy sceptre is Babylon, thy crown is

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>

      Borsippa, the wide heaven is the dwelling-place of thy
      liver.... O lord of the world, light of the spirits of
      heaven, utterer of blessings, who is there whose mouth
      murmurs not of thy righteousness, or speaks not of thy
      glory, and celebrates not thy dominion? O lord of the
      world, who dwellest in the temple of the sun, reject not
      the hands that are raised to thee; be merciful to thy
      city Babylon, to Beth-Saggil thy temple incline thy
      face, grant the prayers of thy people the sons of
      Babylon."'</p>

  <p>Part of the liturgy consisted of prayers addressed to
      the various deities, and suited to various occasions.
      Here are examples of them: 'At dawn and in the night
      prayer should be made to the throne-bearer, and thus
      should it be said: "O throne-bearer, giver of prosperity,
      a prayer!" After that, let prayer be made to Nusku,
      and thus let it be said: "O Nusku, prince and king of
      the secrets of the great gods, a prayer!" After that, let
      prayer be made to Adar, and thus let it be said: "O
      Adar, mighty lord of the deep places of the springs, a
      prayer!" After that let prayer be made to Gula (Beltis),
      and thus let it be said: "O Gula, mother, begetter of
      the black-headed race (of Accadians), a prayer!" After
      that, let prayer be made to Nin-lil, and thus let it be
      said: "O Nin-lil, great goddess, wife of the divine
      prince of sovereignty, a prayer!" After that, let prayer
      be made to Bel, and thus let it be said: "O lord supreme,
      establisher of law, a prayer!" The prayer (must be
      repeated) during the day at dawn, and in the night,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>

      with face and mouth uplifted, during the middle watch.
      Water must be poured out in libation day by day ...
      at dawn, on the beams of the palace.'</p>

  <p>One of the most curious of these petitions is a prayer
      after a bad dream, of which a fragment only has been
      found. This reads as follows: 'May the lord set my
      prayer at rest, (may he remove) my heavy (sin). May
      the lord (grant) a return of favour. By day direct unto
      death all that disquiets me. O my goddess, be gracious
      unto me; when (wilt thou hear) my prayer? May they
      pardon my sin, my wickedness, (and) my transgression.
      May the exalted one deliver, may the holy one love.
      May the seven winds carry away my groaning. May
      the worm lay it low, may the bird bear it upwards to
      heaven. May a shoal of fish carry it away; may the
      river bear it along. May the creeping thing of the field
      come unto me; may the waters of the river as they flow
      cleanse me. Enlighten me like a mask of gold. Food
      and drink before thee perpetually may I get. Heap up
      the worm, take away his life. The steps of thy altar,
      thy many ones, may I ascend. With the worm make me
      pass, and may I be kept with thee. Make me to be fed,
      and may a favourable dream come. May the dream I
      dream be favourable; may the dream I dream be
      fulfilled. May the dream I dream turn to prosperity.
      May Makhir, the god of dreams, settle upon my head.
      Let me enter Beth-Saggil, the palace of the gods, the
      temple of the lord. Give me unto Merodach, the
      merciful, to prosperity, even unto prospering hands.

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>

      May thy entering (O Merodach) be exalted, may thy
      divinity be glorious; may the men of thy city extol thy
      mighty deeds.'</p>

  <p>Along with these prayers, the Assyrians possessed a
      collection of penitential psalms, which were composed at
      a very remote period in Southern Babylonia. The most
      perfect of those of which we have copies is the
      following:—</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>A rubric is attached to this verse, stating that it is
      to be repeated ten times, and at the end of the whole
      psalm is the further rubric: 'For the tearful supplication
      of the heart let the glorious name of every god be
      invoked sixty-five times, and then the heart shall have
      peace.'</p>

  <p>Reference is made in the psalm to the eating of forbidden
      foods, and we have other indications that certain
      kinds of food, among which swine's flesh may be mentioned,
      were not allowed to be consumed. On particular
      days also fasts were observed, and special days of fasting
      and humiliation were prescribed in times of public
      calamity. In the calendar of the Egibi banking firm,
      the 2nd of Tammuz or June is entered as a day of
      'weeping.' The institution of the Sabbath, moreover,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>

      was known to the Babylonians and Assyrians, though
      it was confounded with the feast of the new moon, since
      it was kept, not every seven days, but on the seventh,
      fourteenth, twenty-first, and twenty-eighth days of the
      lunar month. On these days, we read in a sort of
      Saints' calendar for the intercalary Elul: 'Flesh cooked
      on the fire may not be eaten, the clothing of the body
      may not be changed, white garments may not be put on,
      a sacrifice may not be offered, the king may not ride in
      his chariot, nor speak in public, the augur may not
      mutter in a secret place, medicine of the body may not
      be applied, nor may any curse be uttered.' The very
      name of Sabattu or Sabbath was employed by the
      Assyrians, and is defined as 'a day of rest for the heart,'
      while the Accadian equivalent is explained to mean 'a
      day of completion of labour.'</p>

  <p>So far as we are at present acquainted with the
      peculiarities of the Assyro-Babylonian temple, it offers
      many points of similarity to the temple of Solomon at
      Jerusalem. Thus there were an outer and an inner
      court and a shrine, to which the priests alone had access.
      In this was an altar approached by steps, as well as an
      ark or coffer containing two inscribed tablets of stone,
      such as were discovered by Mr. Rassam in the temple of
      Balaw&acirc;t. In the outer court was a large basin, filled
      with water, and called 'a sea,' which was used for
      ablutions and religious ceremonies. At the entrance
      stood colossal figures of winged bulls, termed 'cherubs,'
      which were imagined to prevent the ingress of evil

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>

      spirits. Similar figures guarded the approach to the
      royal palace, and possibly to other houses as well. Some
      of them may now be seen in the British Museum.
      Within, the temples were filled with images of gods,
      great and small, which not only represented the deities
      whose names they bore, but were believed to confer of
      themselves a special sanctity on the place wherein they
      were placed. As among the Israelites, offerings were
      of two kinds, sacrifices and meal offerings. The sacrifice
      consisted of an animal, more usually a bullock, part of
      whose flesh was burnt upon the altar, while the rest was
      handed over to the priests or retained by the offerer.
      There is no trace of human sacrifices among the Assyrians,
      which is the more singular, since we learn that
      human sacrifice had been an Accadian institution. A
      passage in an old astrological work indicates that the
      victims were burnt to death, like the victims of Moloch;
      and an early Accadian fragment expressly states that
      they were to be the children of those for whose sins
      they were offered to the gods. The fragment is as
      follows: 'The son who lifts his head among men, the
      son for his own life must (the father) give; the head of
      the child for the head of the man must he give; the neck
      of the child for the neck of the man must he give; the
      breast of the child for the breast of the man must he
      give.' The idea of vicarious punishment is here clearly
      indicated.</p>

  <p>The future life to which the Babylonian had looked
      forward was dreary enough. Hades, the land of the

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>

      dead, was beneath the earth, a place of darkness and
      gloom, from which 'none might return,' where the spirits
      of the dead flitted like bats, with dust alone for their
      food. Here the shadowy phantoms of the heroes of old
      time sat crowned, each upon his throne, a belief to which
      allusion is made by the Hebrew prophet in his prophecy
      of the coming overthrow of Babylon (Is. xiv. 9).
      In the midst stood the palace of Allat, the queen of the
      underworld, where the waters of life bubbled forth
      beside the golden throne of the spirits of earth, restoring
      those who might drink of them to life and the upper air.
      The entrance to this dreary abode of the departed lay
      beyond Datilla, the river of death, at the mouth of the
      Euphrates, and it was here that the hero Gisdhubar
      saw Xisuthros, the Chaldean Noah, after his translation
      to the fields of the blessed. In later times, when the
      horizon of geographical knowledge was widened, the
      entrance to the gloomy world of Hades, and the earthly
      paradise that was above it, were alike removed to other
      and more unknown regions. The conception of the
      after-life, moreover, was made brighter, at all events, for
      the favoured few. An Assyrian court-poet prays thus
      on behalf of his king: 'The land of the silver sky, oil
      unceasing, the benefits of blessedness may he obtain
      among the feasts of the gods, and a happy cycle among
      their light, even life everlasting, and bliss; such is my
      prayer to the gods who dwell in the land of Assur.'
      Even at a far earlier time we find the great Chaldean epic
      of Gisdhubar concluding with a description of the blissful

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>

      lot of the spirit of Ea-bani: 'On a couch he reclines
      and pure water he drinks. Him who is slain in battle
      thou seest and I see. His father and his mother (support)
      his head, his wife addresses the corpse. His friends
      in the fields are standing; thou seest (them) and I see.
      His spoil on the ground is uncovered; of his spoil he
      hath no oversight, (as) thou seest and I see. His tender
      orphans beg for bread; the food that was stored in (his)
      tent is eaten.' Here the spirit of Ea-bani is supposed to
      behold from his couch in heaven the deeds that take
      place on the earth below.</p>

  <p>Heaven itself had not always been 'the land of the
      silver sky' of later Assyrian belief. The Babylonians
      once believed that the gods inhabited the snow-clad
      peak of Rowandiz, 'the mountain of the world' and 'the
      mountain of the East,' as it was also termed, which
      supported the starry vault of heaven. It is to this old
      Babylonian belief that allusion is made in Isaiah xiv. 13,
      14, where the Babylonian monarch is represented as
      saying in his heart: 'I will ascend into heaven, I will
      exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also
      on the mount of the assembly (of the gods)

  <p>As in all old forms of heathen faith, religion and
      mythology were inextricably mixed together. Myths
      were told of most of the gods. Reference has already
      been made to the myth of Istar and Tammuz, the prototype

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>

      of the Greek legend of Aphrodit&ecirc; and Adonis.
      So, too, the Greek story of the theft of fire by Prometheus
      has its parallel in the Babylonian story of the god
      Zu, 'the divine storm-bird,' who stole the lightning of
      Bel, the tablet whereon the knowledge of futurity is
      written, and who was punished for his crime by the father
      of the gods. In reading the legend of the plague-demon
      Lubara, whom Anu sends to smite the evildoers in
      Babylon, Erech, and other places, we are reminded of
      the avenging angel of God whom David saw standing
      with a drawn sword over Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>One of the most curious of the Babylonian myths was
      that which told how the seven evil-spirits or storm-demons
      had once warred against the moon and threatened
      to devour it. Samas and Istar fled from the lower
      sky, and the Moon-god would have been blotted out
      from heaven had not Bel and Ea sent Merodach in his
      'glistening armour' to rescue him. The myth is really
      a primitive attempt to explain a lunar eclipse, and finds
      its illustration in the dragon of the Chinese, who is still
      popularly believed by them to devour the sun or moon
      when an eclipse takes place.</p>

  <p>The prim&aelig;val victory of light and order over darkness
      and chaos, which seems to be repeated whenever
      the sun bursts through a storm-cloud, was similarly
      expressed in a mythical form. It was the victory of
      Merodach over Tiamat,'the deep,' the personification of
      chaos and elemental anarchy. The myth was embodied
      in a poem, the greater part of which has been preserved

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>

      to us. We are told how Merodach was armed by the
      gods with bow and scimetar, how alone he faced and
      fought the dragon Tiamat, driving the winds into her
      throat when she opened her mouth to swallow him, and
      how, finally, he cut open her body, scattering in flight
      'the rebellious deities' who had stood at her side.
      Tiamat, or the watery chaos, is usually represented with
      wings, claws, tail, and horns, but she is also identified
      with 'the wicked serpent' of 'night and darkness,' 'the
      monstrous serpent of seven heads,' 'which beats the sea.'</p>

  <p>The most interesting of the old myths and traditions
      of Babylonia are those in which we can trace, more or
      less clearly, the lineaments of the accounts of the
      creation of the world and the early history of man,
      given us in the early chapters of Genesis. There was
      more than one legend of the creation. In a text which
      came from the library of Cuthah, it was described as
      taking place on evolutionary principles, the first created
      beings being the brood of chaos, men with 'the bodies
      of birds' and 'the faces of ravens,' who were succeeded
      by the more perfect forms of the existing world. But
      the library of Assur-bani-pal also contained an account
      of the creation, which bears a remarkable resemblance
      to that in the first chapter of Genesis. Unfortunately,
      however, it seems to have been of Assyrian and not
      Babylonian origin, and, therefore, not to have been of
      early date. In this account the creation appears to be
      described as having been accomplished in six days. It
      begins in these words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

  <p>'At that time the heavens above named not a name,
      nor did the earth below record one; yea, the ocean was
      their first creator, the flood of the deep (Tiamat) was
      she who bore them all. Their waters were embosomed
      in one place, and the clouds (?) were not collected, the
      plant was still ungrown. At that time the gods had not
      issued forth, any one of them; by no name were they
      recorded, no destiny (had they fixed). Then the (great)
      gods were made; Lakhmu and Lakhamu issued forth
      the first. They grew up.... Next were made the
      host of heaven and earth. The time was long, (and
      then) the gods Anu, (Bel, and Ea were born of) the host
      of heaven and earth.' The rest of the account is lost,
      and it is not until we come to the fifth tablet of the
      series, which describes the appointment of the heavenly
      bodies, that the narrative is again preserved. Here we
      are told that the creator, who seems to have been Ea,
      'made the stations of the great gods, even the stars,
      fixing the places of the principal stars like ...
      He ordered the year, setting over it the decans; yea, he
      established three stars for each of the twelve months.'
      It will be remembered that, according to Genesis, the
      appointment of the heavenly bodies to guide and govern
      the seasons was the work of the fourth day, and since
      the work is described in the fifth tablet or book of the
      Assyrian account, while the first tablet describes the
      condition of the universe before the creation was begun,
      it becomes probable that the Assyrians also knew that
      the work was performed on the fourth day. The next

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>

      tablet states that 'at that time the gods in their
      assembly created (the living creatures). They made
      the mighty (animals). They caused the living beings
      to come forth, the cattle of the field, the beast of the
      field, and the creeping thing.' Unfortunately the rest of
      the narrative is in too mutilated a condition for a
      translation to be possible, and the part which describes
      the creation of man has not yet been recovered among the
      ruins of the library of Nineveh.</p>

  <p>The Chaldean account of the Deluge was discovered
      by Mr. George Smith, and its close resemblance to the
      account in Genesis is well known. Those who wish to
      see a translation of it, according to the latest researches,
      will find one in the pages of 'Fresh Light from the
      Ancient Monuments.' The account was introduced as
      an episode into the eleventh book of the great Babylonian
      epic of Gisdhubar, and appears to be the amalgamation
      of two older poems on the subject. The story
      of the Deluge, in fact, was a favourite theme among the
      Babylonians, and we have fragments of at least two
      other versions of it, neither of which, however, agree so
      remarkably with the Biblical narrative as does the
      version discovered by Mr. Smith. Apart from the profound
      difference caused by the polytheistic character of
      the Chaldean account, and the monotheism of the
      Scriptural narrative, it is only in details that the two
      accounts vary from one another. Thus, the vessel in
      which Xisuthros, the Chaldean Noah, sails, is a ship,
      guided by a steersman, and not an ark, and others

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>

      besides his own family are described as being admitted
      into it. So, too, the period of time during which the
      flood was at its height is said to have been seven days
      only, while, beside the raven and the dove, Xisuthros is
      stated to have sent out a third bird, the swallow, in
      order to determine how far the waters had subsided.
      The Chaldean ark rested, moreover, on Rowandiz, the
      highest of the mountains of Eastern Kurdistan, and
      the peak whereon Accadian mythology imagined the
      heavens to be supported, and not on the northern or
      Armenian continuation of the range. Babylonian tradition,
      too, had fused into one Noah and Enoch, Xisuthros
      being represented as translated to the land of immortality
      immediately after his descent from the ark and
      his sacrifice to the gods. It is noticeable that the
      Chaldean account agrees with that of the Bible in one
      remarkable respect, in which it differs from almost all
      the other traditions of the Deluge found throughout the
      world. This is in its ascribing the cause of the Deluge
      to the wickedness of mankind. It was sent as a punishment
      for sin.</p>

  <p>As might have been expected, the Babylonians and
      Assyrians knew of the building of the Tower of Babel,
      and the dispersion of mankind. Men had 'turned
      against the father of all the gods,' under a leader the
      thoughts of whose heart 'were evil.' At Babylon they
      began to erect 'a mound,' or hill-like tower, but the
      winds destroyed it in the night, and Anu 'confounded
      great and small on the mound,' as well as their 'speech,'

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>

      and 'made strange their counsel.' All this was supposed
      to have taken place at the time of the autumnal equinox,
      and it is possible that the name of the rebel leader,
      which is lost, was Et&aacute;na. At all events the demi-god
      Et&aacute;na played a conspicuous part in the early historical
      mythology of Babylonia, like two other famous divine
      kings, Ner and Dun, and a fragment describes him as
      having built a city of brick. However this may be,
      Et&aacute;na is the Babylonian Titan of Greek writers, who,
      with Prom&ecirc;theus and Ogygos, made war against the
      gods.</p>

  <p>If we sum up the character of Assyrian religion, we
      shall find it characterised by curious contrasts. On the
      one hand we shall find it grossly polytheistic, believing
      in 'lords many and gods many,' and admitting not only
      gods and demi-gods, and even deified men, but the
      multitudinous spirits, 'the host of heaven and earth,'
      who were classed together as the '300 spirits of heaven
      and the 600 spirits of earth.' Some of these were
      beneficent, others hostile, to man. In addition to this
      vast army of divine powers, the Assyrian offered worship
      also to the heavenly bodies, and to the spirits of rivers
      and mountains. He even set up stones or 'Beth-els,' so
      called because they were imagined to be veritable
      'houses of god,' wherein the godhead dwelt, and over
      these he poured out libations of oil and wine. Yet, on
      the other hand, with all this gross polytheism, there was
      a strong tendency to monotheism. The supreme god,
      Assur, is often spoken of in language which at first sight

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>

      seems monotheistic: to him the Assyrian monarchs
      ascribe their victories, and in his name they make war
      against the unbeliever. A similar inconsistency prevailed
      in the character of Assyrian worship itself. There was
      much in it which commands our admiration: the
      Assyrian confessed his sins to his gods, he begged
      for their pardon and help, he allowed nothing to
      interfere with what he conceived to be his religious
      duties. With all this, his worship of Istar was stained
      with the foulest excesses—excesses, too, indulged in,
      like those of the Phœnicians, in the name and for the
      sake of religion.</p>

  <p>Much of this inconsistency may be explained by the
      history of his religious ideas. As we have seen, a large
      part of them was derived from a non-Semitic population,
      the primitive inhabitants of Babylonia, under whose
      influence the Semitic Babylonians had come at a time
      when they still lacked nearly all the elements of culture.
      The result was a form of creed in which the old
      Accadian faith was bodily taken over by an alien race,
      but at the same time profoundly modified. It was
      Accadian religion interpreted by the Semitic mind and
      belief. Baal-worship, which saw the Sun-god everywhere
      under an infinite variety of manifestations, waged a
      constant struggle with the conceptions of the borrowed
      creed, but never overcame them altogether. The gods
      and spirits of the Accadians remained to the last, although
      permeated and overlaid with the worship of the Semitic
      Sun-god. As time went on, new religious elements were

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>

      introduced, and Assyro-Babylonian religion underwent
      new phases, while in Assyria itself the deified state in
      the person of the god Assur tended to absorb the
      religious cult and aspirations of the people. The higher
      minds of the nation struggled now and again towards
      the conception of one supreme God and of a purer form
      of faith, but the dead weight of polytheistic beliefs and
      practices prevented them from ever really reaching it.
      In the best examples of their religious literature we
      constantly fall across expressions and ideas which show
      how wide was the gulf that separated them from that
      kindred people of Israel to whom the oracles of God
      were revealed.</p>

  <p>Assyrian art was, speaking generally, imported from
      Babylonia. Even the palace of the king was built of
      bricks, and raised upon a mound like the palaces and
      temples of Babylonia, although stone was plentiful
      in Assyria, and there was no marshy plain where
      inundations might be feared. It was only the walls that
      were lined with sculptured slabs of alabaster, the
      sculptures taking the place of the paintings in vermilion,
      which adorned the houses of Babylonia (Ezek. xxiii. 14).</p>

  <p>It is at Khorsabad, or Dur-Sargon, the city built by
      Sargon, to the north of Nineveh, that we can best study
      the architectural genius of Assyria. The city was laid
      out in the form of a square, and surrounded by walls
      forty-six feet thick and over a mile in length each way,
      the angles of which faced the four cardinal points. The
      outer wall was flanked with eight tall towers, and was
      erected on a mound of rubble.</p>

  <p>On the north-west side stood the royal palace, defended
      also by a wall of its own, and built on a
    <a id="TNanchor_2_2" name="TNanchor_2_2"></a>
    <a href="#TN_2_2" class="msg"
        title="Over-sized 'T' symbol">T</a>-shaped
      platform. It was approached through an outer court,
      the gates of which were hung under arches of enamelled
      brick, and guarded by colossal figures in stone. From

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>

      the court an inclined plane led to the first terrace,
      occupied by a number of small rooms, in which the
      French excavators saw the barracks of the palace-guard.
      Above this terrace rose a second, at a height of about
      ten feet, upon which was built the royal palace
      itself. This was entered through a gateway, on either
      side of which stood the stone figure of a 'cherub,' while
      within it was a court 350 feet long and 170 feet wide.
      Beyond this court was an inner one, which formed a
      square of 150 feet. On its left were the royal chambers,
      consisting of a suite of ten rooms, and beyond them
      again the private chapel of the monarch, leading to the
      apartments in which he commonly lived. On the west
      side of the palace rose a tower, built in stages, on the
      summit of which was the royal observatory.</p>

  <p>It is a question whether the Assyrian palace possessed
      any upper stories. On the whole, probability speaks
      against it. Columns, however, were used plentifully.
      The column, in fact, had been a Babylonian invention,
      and originated in the necessity of supporting buildings
      on wooden pillars in a country where there was no stone.
      From Babylonia columnar architecture passed into
      Assyria, where it assumed exaggerated forms, the
      column being sometimes made to rest on the backs of
      lions, dogs, and winged bulls.</p>

  <p>The apertures which served as windows were protected
      by heavy folds of tapestry, that kept out the heats
      of summer and the cold winds of winter. In warm
      weather, however, the inmates of the house preferred to

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>

      sit in the open air, either in the airy courts upon which
      its chambers opened, or under the shady trees of the
      <em>paradeisos</em> or park attached to the
      dwellings of the rich. The leases of houses
      let or sold in Nineveh in the time
      of the Second Assyrian Empire generally make mention
      of the 'shrubbery,' which formed part of the property.</p>

  <p>Assyrian sculpture was for the most part in relief.
      The Assyrians carved badly in the round, unlike the
      Babylonians, some of whose sitting statues are not
      wanting in an air of dignity and repose. But they
      excelled in that kind of shallow relief of which so many
      examples have been brought to the British Museum.
      We can trace three distinct periods in the history of this
      form of art. The first period is that which begins, so far
      as we know at present, with the age of Assur-natsir-pal.
      It is characterised by boldness and vigour, by an absence
      of background or landscape, and by an almost total want
      of perspective. With very few exceptions, faces and
      figures are drawn in profile. But with all this want of
      skill, the work is often striking from the spirit with
      which it is executed, and the naturalness with which
      animals, more especially, are depicted. A bas-relief
      representing a lion-hunt of Assur-natsir-pal has been
      often selected as a typical, though favourable, illustration
      of the art of this age.</p>

  <p>The second period extends from the foundation of the
      Second Assyrian Empire to the reign of Esar-haddon.
      The artist has lost in vigour, but has compensated for it
      by care and accuracy. The foreground is now filled in

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>

      with vegetable and other forms, all drawn with a
      pre-Raffaellite exactitude. The relief consequently becomes
      exceedingly rich, and produces the effect of embroidery
      in stone. It is probable that the delicate minuteness of
      this period of art was in great measure due to the work
      in ivory that had now become fashionable at Nineveh.</p>

  <p>The third, and best period, is that of the reign of
      Assur-bani-pal. There is a return to the freedom of the
      first period, but without its accompanying rudeness and
      want of skill. The landscape is either left bare, or
      indicated in outline only, the attention of the spectator
      being thus directed to the principal sculpture itself.
      The delineation of the human figure has much improved;
      vegetable forms have lost much of their stiffness,
      and we meet with several examples of successful
      foreshortening. Up to the last, however, the Assyrian
      artist succeeded but badly in human portraiture.
      Nothing can surpass some of his pictures of animals;
      when he came to deal with the human figure he expended
      his strength on embroidered robes and the
      muscles of the legs and arms. The reason of this is not
      difficult to discover. Unlike the Egyptian, who excelled
      in the delineation of the human form, he did not draw
      from nude models. The details of the drapery were
      with him of more importance than the features of the
      face or the posture of the limbs. We cannot expect to
      find portraits in the sculptures of Assyria. Little, if any,
      attempt is made even to distinguish the natives of
      different foreign countries from one another, except in

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>

      the way of dress. All alike have the same features as
      the Assyrians themselves.</p>

  <p>The effect of the bas-reliefs was enhanced by the
      red, black, blue, and white colours with which they were
      picked out. The practice had come from Babylonia,
      but whereas the Babylonians delighted in brilliant
      colouring, their northern neighbours contented themselves
      with much more sober hues. It was no doubt
      from the populations of Mesopotamia that the Greeks
      first learnt to paint and tint their sculptured stone.
      Unfortunately it is difficult, if not impossible, to find
      any trace of colouring remaining in the Assyrian bas-reliefs
      now in Europe. When first disinterred, however,
      the colours were still bright in many cases, although
      exposure to the air soon caused them to fade and
      perish.</p>

  <p>The bas-reliefs and colossi were moved from the
      quarries out of which they had been dug, or the workshops
      in which they had been carved, by the help of sledges
      and rollers. Hundreds of captives were employed to
      drag the huge mass along; sometimes it was transported
      by water, the boat on which it lay being pulled
      by men on shore; sometimes it was drawn over the
      land by gangs of slaves, urged to their work by the rod
      and sword of their task-masters. On the colossus itself
      stood an overseer holding to his mouth what looks on
      the monument like a modern speaking-trumpet. Over
      a sculpture representing the transport of one of these
      colossi Sennacherib has engraved the words: 'Sennacherib,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a>
  <a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a>
  <a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>

      king of legions, king of Assyria, has caused the
      winged bull and the colossi, the divinities which were
      made in the land of the city of the Baladians, to be
      brought with joy to the palace of his lordship, which is
      within Nineveh.' We may infer from this epigraph that
      the images themselves were believed to be in some way
      the abode of divinity, like the Beth-els or sacred stones
      to which reference has been made in the last chapter.</p>

  <p>Like Assyrian art, Assyrian literature was for the
      most part derived from Babylonia. A large portion of
      it was translated from Accadian originals. Sometimes
      the original was lost or forgotten; more frequently it
      was re-edited from time to time with interlinear or
      parallel translations in Assyro-Babylonian. This was
      more especially the case with the sacred texts, in which
      the old language of Accad was itself accounted sacred,
      like Latin in the services of the Roman Catholic Church,
      or Coptic in those of the modern Egyptian Church.</p>

  <p>The Accadians had been the inventors of the hieroglyphics
      or pictorial characters out of which the
      cuneiform characters had afterwards grown. Writing
      begins with pictures, and the writing of the Babylonians
      formed no exception to the rule. The pictures were at
      first painted on the papyrus leaves which grew in the
      marshes of the Euphrates, but as time went on a new and
      more plentiful writing material came to be employed in
      the shape of clay. Clay was literally to be found under
      the feet of every one. All that was needed was to
      impress it, while still wet, with the hieroglyphic pictures,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>

      and then dry it in the sun. It is probable that the
      bricks used in the construction of the great buildings of
      Chaldea were first treated in this way. At all events we
      find that up to the last, the Babylonian kings stamped
      their names and titles in the middle of such bricks, and
      hundreds of them may be met with in the museums of
      Europe bearing the name of Nebuchadnezzar. When
      once the discovery was made that clay could be
      employed as a writing material, it was quickly turned to
      good account. All Babylonia began to write on tablets
      of clay, and though papyrus continued to be used, it was
      reserved for what we should now term '&eacute;ditions de
      luxe.' The writing instrument had originally been the
      edge of a stone or a piece of stick, but these were soon
      superseded by a metal stylus with a square head. Under
      the combined influence of the clay tablet and the metal
      stylus, the old picture-writing began to degenerate into
      the cuneiform or 'wedge-shaped' characters with which
      the monuments of Assyria have made us familiar.
      It was difficult, if not impossible, any longer to draw
      circles and curves, and accordingly angles took the
      place of circles, and straight lines the place of curves.
      Continuous lines were equally difficult to form; it was
      easier to represent them by a series of indentations, each
      of which took a wedge-like appearance from the square
      head of the stylus. As soon as the exact forms of the
      old pictures began to be obliterated, other alterations
      became inevitable. The forms began to be simplified by
      the omission of lines or wedges which were no longer

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>

      necessary, now that the character had become a mere
      symbol instead of a picture; and this process of
      simplification went on from one century to another, until
      in many instances the later form of a character is hardly
      more than a shadow of what it originally was. Education
      was widely spread in Babylonia; in spite of the
      cumbrousness and intricacy of the system of writing, there
      were few, it would appear, who could not read and write,
      and hence, as was natural, all kinds of handwritings
      were prevalent, some good and some bad. Among
      these various cursive or running hands were some which
      were selected for public documents; but as the hands
      varied, not only among individuals, but also from age
      to age, the official script never became fixed and
      permanent, but changed constantly, each change,
      however, bringing with it increased simplicity in the
      shapes of the characters, and a greater departure
      from the primitive hieroglyphic form. The earliest
      contemporaneous monuments with which we are at present
      acquainted, are those recently excavated by the French
      Consul M. de Sarzec at a place called Tel-Loh; on
      these we see the early pictures in the very act of
      passing into cuneiform characters, the pictures being
      sometimes preserved and sometimes already lost. A
      comparison of the forms found at Tel-Loh with those
      usually employed in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, will
      show at a glance what profound modifications were
      undergone by the cuneiform syllabary in the course of
      its transmission from generation to generation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">
    <a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

  <p>In contrast to the Babylonians, the Assyrians were a
      nation of warriors and huntsmen, not of students, and
      with them, therefore, a knowledge of writing was confined
      to a particular class, that of the scribes. At an
      early period, accordingly, in the history of the kingdom,
      a special form of script was adopted not only in official
      documents, but in private documents as well, and this
      script remained practically unchanged down to the fall
      of Nineveh. This form of script was one of the many
      simplified forms of handwriting that were used in
      Babylonia, and it was fortunately a very clear and
      well-defined one. Now and then, it is true, contact with
      Babylonia made an Assyrian king desirous of imitating
      the archaic writing of Babylonia, and inscriptions were
      consequently engraved in florid characters, abounding in
      a multiplicity of needless wedges, and reminding us of
      our modern black-letter. Such ornamental inscriptions
      are not numerous, and were carved only on stone. The
      clay literature was all written in the ordinary Assyrian
      characters, except when the scribe was unable to
      recognise a character in a Babylonian text he was
      copying, and so reproduced it exactly in his copy.</p>

  <p>The clay tablets used by the Assyrians were an
      improvement on those of Babylonia. Instead of being
      merely dried in the sun, they were thoroughly baked in
      a kiln, holes being drilled through them here and there
      to allow the steam to escape. As a rule, therefore, the
      tablets of Assyria are smaller than those of Babylonia,
      since there was always a danger of a large tablet being

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a>
  <a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a>
  <a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>

      broken in the fire. In consequence of the small size of
      the tablets, and the amount of text with which it was
      often necessary to cover them, the characters impressed
      upon them are frequently minute, so minute, indeed, as
      to suggest that they must have been written with the
      help of a magnifying glass. This supposition is confirmed
      by the existence of a magnifying lens of crystal
      discovered by Sir A. H. Layard on the site of the library
      of Nineveh, and now in the British Museum.</p>

  <p>A literary people like the Babylonians needed
      libraries, and libraries were accordingly established at a
      very early period in all the great cities of the country,
      and plentifully stocked with books in papyrus and clay.
      In imitation of these Babylonian libraries, libraries were
      also founded in Assyria by the Assyrian kings. There
      was a library at Assur, and another at Calah which
      seems to have been as old as the city itself. But the
      chief library of Assyria that, in fact, from which most of
      the Assyrian literature we possess has come, was the
      great library of Nineveh (Kouyunjik). This owed its
      magnitude and reputation to Assur-bani-pal, who filled
      it with copies of the plundered books of Babylonia. A
      whole army of scribes was employed in it, busily engaged
      in writing and editing old texts. Assur-bani-pal is
      never weary of telling us, in the colophon at the end of
      the last tablet of a series which made up a single work,
      that 'Nebo and Tasmit had given him broad ears and
      enlightened his eyes so as to see the engraved characters
      of the written tablets, whereof none of the kings that

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>

      had gone before had seen this text, the wisdom of Nebo,
      all the literature of the library that exists,' so that he
      had 'written, engraved, and explained it on tablets,
      and placed it within his palace for the inspection of
      readers.'</p>

  <p>A good deal of the literature was of a lexical and
      grammatical kind, and was intended to assist the
      Semitic student in interpreting the old Accadian
      texts. Lists of characters were drawn up with their
      pronunciation in Accadian and the translation into
      Assyrian of the words represented by them. Since the
      Accadian pronunciation of a character was frequently
      the phonetic value attached to it by the Assyrians,
      these syllabaries, as they have been termed—in
      consequence of the fact that the cuneiform characters
      denoted syllables and not letters—have been of the
      greatest possible assistance in the decipherment of the
      inscriptions. Besides the syllabaries, the Semitic scribes
      compiled tables of Accadian words and grammatical
      forms with their Assyro-Babylonian equivalents, as well
      as lists of the names of animals, birds, reptiles, fish,
      stones, vegetables, medicines, and the like in the two
      languages. There are even geographical and astronomical
      lists, besides long lists of Assyrian synonyms
      and the titles of military and civil officers.</p>

  <p>Other tablets contain phrases and sentences extracted
      from some particular Accadian work and explained in
      Assyrian, while others again are exercises or reading-books
      intended for boys at school, who were learning

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>

      the old dead language of Chaldea. In addition to
      these helps whole texts were provided with Assyrian
      translations, sometimes interlinear, sometimes placed in
      a parallel column on the right-hand side; so that it
      is not wonderful that the Assyrians now and then
      attempted to write in the extinct Accadian, just as we
      write nowadays in Latin, though in both cases, it must
      be confessed, not always with success.</p>

  <p>Accadian, however, was not the only language besides
      his own that the Semitic Babylonian or Assyrian was
      required to know. Aramaic had become the common
      language of trade and diplomacy, so that not only was
      it assumed by the ministers of Hezekiah that an official
      like the Rab-shakeh or Vizier of Sennacherib could
      speak it as a matter of course (2 Kings xviii. 26),
      but even in trading documents we find the Aramaic
      language and alphabet used side by side with the
      Assyrian cuneiform. This common use of Aramaic
      explains how it was that the Jews after the Babylonish
      captivity gave up their own language in favour not of
      the Assyro-Babylonian, but of the Aramaic of Northern
      Syria and Arabia. An educated Assyrian was thus
      expected to be able to read and write a dead language,
      Accadian, and to read, write, and speak a foreign living
      language, Aramaic. In addition to these languages,
      moreover, he took an interest in others which were
      spoken by his neighbours around him. The Rab-shakeh
      of Sennacherib was able to speak Hebrew, and
      tablets have been discovered giving the Assyrian

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>

      renderings of lists of words from the barbarous dialects
      of the Koss&aelig;ans in the mountains of Elam and of the
      Semitic nomads on the western side of the Euphrates.</p>

  <p>All the branches of knowledge known at the time
      were treated of in Assyrian literature, though naturally
      history, legend, and poetry occupied a prominent place
      in it. But even such subjects as the despatches of
      generals in the field, or the copies of royal
      correspondence found a place in the public library. The
      chronology of Assyria, and therewith of the Old
      Testament also, has been restored by means of the lists
      of successive 'eponyms' or officers after whom the
      years were named, while a recent discovery has brought
      to light a table of Semitic Babylonian kings, arranged
      in dynasties, which traces them back to
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2330.</p>

  <p>A flood of light has been poured on Chaldean
      astronomy and astrology, by the fragments of the
      original work called 'The Observations of Bel' which was
      translated into Greek by the Babylonian priest
      B&ecirc;r&ocirc;ssos.
      It consisted of seventy-two books, and was compiled
      for king Sargon of Accad, whose date is assigned by
      Nabonidos to <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 3800. Another
      work on omens, in
      137 books, had been compiled for the same king, and
      both remained to the last days of the Assyrian Empire
      the standard treatises on the subjects with which they
      dealt. To the same period we should probably refer a
      treatise on agriculture, extracts from which have been
      preserved in a reading-book in Accadian and Assyrian.
      Here the songs are quoted with which the Accadian

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>

      ox-drivers beguiled their labours in the field: 'An heifer am
      I: to the cow thou art yoked: the plough's handle
      is strong: lift it up lift it up;' or again: 'The knees are
      marching, the feet are not resting; with no wealth of
      thy own grain thou begettest for me.' Some of the
      most curious specimens of this department of literature
      are the fables, riddles, and proverbs, which embody the
      homely wisdom of the unofficial classes.</p>

  <p>Here, for instance, is a riddle propounded to Nergal
      and the other gods by 'the wise man,' such as Orientals
      still delight in:</p>

  <p>'What is (found) in the house; what is (concealed)
      in the secret place; what is (fixed) in the foundation of
      the house; what exists on the floor of the house; what
      is (perceived) in the lower part (of the house); what
      goes down by the sides of the house; what in the ditch
      of the house (makes) broad furrows; what roars like a
      bull; what brays like an ass; what flutters like a sail;
      what bleats like a sheep; what barks like a dog; what
      growls like a bear; what enters into a man; what enters
      into a woman?' The answer is, of course, the air or wind.</p>

  <p>Among the most treasured portions of the library of
      Nineveh was the poetical literature, comprising epics,
      hymns to the gods, psalms and songs. Fifteen of these
      songs, we are told, were arranged on the eastern and
      northern sides of the building, 'on the western side
      being nine songs to Assur, Bel the voice of the
      firmament, the Southern Sun,' and another god. The
      mention of songs to Assur shows that there were some

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>

      which were of Assyrian origin. The epics, however, all
      came from Babylonia, and were partly translations from
      Accadian, partly independent compositions of Semitic
      Babylonian poets. The names of the reputed authors
      of many of them have come down to us. Thus the
      great epic of Gisdhubar was ascribed to Sin-liki-unnini;
      the legend of Et&aacute;na to Nis-Sin; the fable of
      the fox to Ru-Merodach the son of Nitakh-Dununa.</p>

  <p>The epic of Gisdhubar, as has already been stated,
      contained the account of the Deluge, introduced as an
      episode into the eleventh book. It consisted in all of
      twelve books, and was arranged upon an astronomical
      principle, the subject-matter of each of the books being
      made to correspond with one of the signs of Zodiac.
      Thus the fifth book records the death of a monstrous
      lion at the hands of Gisdhubar, answering to the
      Zodiacal Leo; in the sixth book the hero is vainly
      wooed by Istar, the Virgo of the Zodiacal signs; and
      just as Aquarius is in the eleventh Zodiacal sign, so the
      history of the Deluge is embodied in the eleventh book.
      There was a special reason, however, for this arrangement;
      Gisdhubar himself was a solar hero. He seems
      originally to have been the fire-stick of the primitive
      Accadians, and then the god or spirit of the fire it
      produced, eventually in the Semitic period passing first
      into a form of the Sun-god, and then into a solar hero.
      His twelve labours or adventures answer to the twelve
      months of the year through which the sun moves, like
      the twelve labours of the Greek H&ecirc;rakl&ecirc;s.
      The latter,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>

      indeed, were simply the twelve labours of Gisdhubar
      transported to the west. The Greeks received many
      myths and mythological conceptions from the
      Phœnicians, along with their early culture, and these
      myths had themselves been brought by the Phœnicians
      from their original home in Chaldea. It has long been
      recognised that H&ecirc;rakl&ecirc;s was the
      borrowed Phœnician
      Sun-god; we now know that his primitive prototype
      had been adopted by the Phœnicians from the Accadians
      of Babylonia. It is not strange, therefore, that just as in
      the Greek myth of Aphrodit&ecirc; and Ad&ocirc;nis we find
      the outlines of the old Chaldean story of Istar and Tammuz,
      so in the legends of H&ecirc;rakl&ecirc;s we find an echo of
      the legends of Gisdhubar. The lion destroyed by
      Gisdhubar is the lion of Nemea; the winged bull
      made by Anu to avenge the slight offered to Istar is
      the winged bull of Krete; the tyrant Khumbaba, slain
      by Gisdhubar in 'the land of pine-trees, the seat of the
      gods, the sanctuary of the spirits'
      is the tyrant Gery&ocirc;n;
      the gems borne by the trees of the forest beyond 'the
      gateway of the sun' are the apples of the Hesperides;
      and the deadly sickness of Gisdhubar himself is but the
      fever sent by the poisoned tunic of Nessos through
      the veins of the Greek hero. It is curious thus to trace
      to their first source the myths which have made so deep
      an impress on classical art and literature. The indebtedness
      of European culture to the valley of the Euphrates
      is becoming more and more apparent every year.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to determine the age of the great

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>

      Chaldean epic, but it must have been composed subsequently
      to the period when, through the precession of
      the equinoxes, Aries came to be the first sign of the
      Zodiac instead of Taurus, that is to say, about
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2500.
      On the other hand, it is difficult to make it later than
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2000, while the whole
      character and texture of the
      poem shows that it has been put together from older
      lays, which have been united into a single whole. The
      poem deservedly continued to be a favourite among the
      Babylonians and Assyrians, and more than one edition
      of it was made for the library of Assur-bani-pal. A
      translation of all the portions of it that have
      been discovered will be found in George Smith's
      'Chaldean Account of Genesis.'</p>

  <p>It is difficult for the English reader to appreciate
      justly the real character of many of these old poems.
      The tablets on which they are inscribed were broken in
      pieces when Nineveh was destroyed, and the roof of the
      library fell in upon them. A text, therefore, has generally
      to be pieced together from a number of fragments,
      leaving gaps and lacun&aelig; which mar the pleasure of
      reading it. Then, again, the translator frequently comes
      across a word or phrase which is new to him, and which
      he is consequently obliged to leave untranslated or to
      render purely conjecturally. At times there is a lacuna
      in the original text itself. When the Assyrian scribe
      was unable to read the tablet he was copying, either
      because the characters had been effaced by time or
      because their Babylonian forms were unknown to him,

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>

      he wrote the word <em>khibi</em>, 'it is wanting,'
      and left a blank
      in his text. It is not wonderful, therefore, that what is
      really a fine piece of literature reads tamely and poorly
      in its English dress, more especially when we remember
      that the decipherer is compelled to translate literally,
      and cannot have recourse to those idiomatic paraphrases
      which are permissible when we are dealing with known
      languages.</p>

  <p>But it must be confessed that many of the best compositions
      of Babylonia are spoilt for us by the references
      to a puerile superstition, and the ever-present dread of
      witchcraft and magic which they contain. A good
      example of this curious mixture of exalted thought and
      debasing superstition is the following
      hymn to the Sun-god:—</p>

  <blockquote class="blockhang">

  <p>Even the science of the Babylonians and their Assyrian
      disciples was not free from superstition. Astronomy
      was mixed with astrology, and their observation of
      terrestrial phenomena led only to an elaborate system
      of augury. The false assumption was made that an
      event was caused by another which had immediately
      preceded it; and hence it was laid down that whenever
      two events had been observed to follow one upon the
      other, the recurrence of the first would cause the other
      to follow again. The assumption was an illustration of
      the well-known fallacy: 'Post hoc, ergo propter
    <a name="TNanchor_3_3" id="TNanchor_3_3"></a>
    <a href="#TN_3_3" class="msg"
        title="Quote added at end">hoc.'</a>
      It produced both the pseudo-science of astrology and
      the pseudo-science of augury.</p>


  <p>The standard work on astronomy, as has already been
      noted, was that called 'The Observations of Bel,' compiled
      originally for the library of Sargon I at Accad.
      Additions were made to it from time to time, the chief
      object of the work being to notice the events which
      happened after each celestial phenomenon. Thus the
      occurrences which at different periods followed a solar
      eclipse on a particular day were all duly introduced
      into the text and piled, as it were, one upon the other.
      The table of contents prefixed to the work showed that

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>

      it treated of various matters—eclipses of the sun and
      moon, the conjunction of the sun and moon, the phases
      of Venus and Mars, the position of the pole-star, the
      changes of the weather, the appearance of comets, or, as
      they are called, 'stars with a tail behind and a corona in
      front,' and the like. The immense collection of records
      of eclipses indicates the length of time during which
      observations of the heavens had been carried on. As it
      is generally stated whether a solar eclipse had happened
      'according to calculation' or 'contrary to calculation,' it
      is clear that the Babylonians were acquainted at an
      early date with the periodicity of eclipses of the sun.
      The beginning of the year was determined by the
      position of the star Dilgan (α Aurig&aelig;) in relation to
      the new moon at the vernal equinox, and the night
      was originally divided into three watches. Subsequently
      the <em>kasbu</em> or 'double hour' was introduced to mark
      time, twelve <em>kasbu</em> being equivalent
      to a night and day.
      Time itself was measured by a clepsydra or water-clock,
      as well as by a gnomon or dial. The dial set up by
      Ahaz at Jerusalem (2 Kings xx. 11) was doubtless one
      of the fruits of his intercourse with the Assyrians.</p>

  <p>The Zodiacal signs had been marked out and named
      at that remote period when the sun was still in Taurus
      at the beginning of spring, and the equator had been
      divided into sixty degrees. The year was correspondingly
      divided into twelve months, each of thirty days,
      intercalary months being counted in by the priests when
      necessary. The British Museum possesses fragments of

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>

      a planisphere from Nineveh, representing the sky at the
      time of the vernal equinox, the constellation of Tammuz
      or Orion being specially noticeable upon it. Another
      tablet contains a table of lunar longitudes.</p>

  <p>With all this attention to astronomical matters it is
      not surprising that every great city boasted of an
      observatory, erected on the summit of a lofty tower.
      Astronomers were appointed by the state to take charge
      of these observatories, and to send in fortnightly reports
      to the king. Here are specimens of them, the first of
      which is dated <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 649:—'To
      the king, my lord, thy
      servant Istar-iddin-pal, one of the chief astronomers of
      Arbela. May there be peace to the king, my lord, may
      Nebo, Merodach, and Istar of Arbela, be favourable to
      the king, my lord. On the twenty-ninth day we kept a
      watch. The observatory was covered with cloud: the
      moon we did not see. (Dated) the month Sebat, the
      first day, the eponymy of Bel-kharran-Sadua.' 'To
      the king, my lord, thy servant Abil-Istar. May there
      be peace to the king, my lord. May Nebo and Merodach
      be propitious to the king, my lord. May the great
      gods grant unto the king, my lord, long days, soundness
      of body, and joy of heart. On the twenty-seventh day
      (of the month) the moon disappeared. On the twenty-eighth,
      twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days, we kept a
      watch for the eclipse of the sun. But the sun did not
      pass into eclipse. On the first day the moon was seen
      during the day. During the month Tammuz (June) it
      was above the planet Mercury, as I have already reported

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>

      to the king. During the period when the moon is called
      Anu (<em>i.e.</em>, from the first to the fifth days
      of the lunar month), it was seen declining in the orbit of
      Arcturus. Owing to the rain the horn was not visible.
      Such is my report. During the period when the moon
      was Anu, I sent to the king, my lord, the following
      account of its conjunction:—It was stationary and
      visible below the star of the chariot. During the period
      when the moon is called Bel (<em>i.e.</em>,
      from the tenth to the
      fifteenth day), it became full; to the star of the chariot
      it approached. Its conjunction (with the star) was prevented;
      but its conjunction with Mercury, during the
      period when it was Anu, of which I have already sent a
      report to the king, my lord, was not prevented. May
      the king, my lord, have peace!'</p>

  <p>Astronomical observations imply a knowledge of
      mathematics, and in this the Babylonians and Assyrians
      seem to have excelled. Tables of squares and
      cubes have been found at Senkereh, the ancient Larsa,
      and a series of geometrical figures used for augural
      purposes presupposes a sort of Babylonian Euclid.
      The mathematical unit was 60, which was understood
      as a multiple when high numbers had to be expressed,
      IV, for example, standing for (4 &times; 60 =) 240. Similarly,
      60 was the unwritten denominator of fractional numbers.
      The plan of an estate outside the gate of Zamama
      at Babylon, and belonging to the time of Nebuchadnezzar,
      has been discovered, while the famous Hanging
      Gardens of that city were watered by means of a screw.</p>

  <p>Medicine also was in a more advanced state than
      might have been expected. Fragments of an old work
      on medicine have been found, which show that all
      known diseases had been classified, and their symptoms
      described, the medical mixtures considered appropriate
      to each being compounded and prescribed quite in
      modern fashion. Here is one of them: 'For a diseased
      gall-bladder, which devours the top of a man's heart
      like a ring(?) ... within the sick (part), we prepare
      cypress-extract, goats' milk, palm-wine, barley, the
      flesh of an ox and bear, and the wine of the cellarer, in
      order that the sick man may live. Half an ephah of
      clear honey, half an ephah of cypress-extract, half an
      ephah of <em>gamgam</em> herbs,
      half an ephah of linseed, half an
      ephah of ..., half an ephah of <em>imdi</em> herbs,
      half an ephah of the seed of <em>tarrati</em>,
      half an ephah of calves' milk,
      half an ephah of <em>senu</em> wood,
      half an ephah of <em>tik</em> powder, half an
      ephah of the ... of the river-god, half an
      ephah of <em>usu</em> wood, half an
      ephah of mountain medicine,
      half an ephah of the flesh(?) of a dove, half an ephah of
      the seed of the ..., half an ephah of the corn of
      the field, ten measures of the juice of a cut herb, ten
      measures of the tooth of the sea (sea-weed), one ephah
      of putrid flesh(?), one ephah of dates, one ephah of
      palm-wine and <em>insik</em>, and .*
      one ephah of the flesh(?) of
      the entrails; slice and cut up; or mix as a mixture,
      after first stirring it with a reed. On the fourth day
      observe (the sick man's) countenance. If it shows a
      white appearance his heart is cured; if it shows a dark

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>

      appearance his heart is still devoured by the fire; if it
      shows a yellow appearance during the day, the patient's
      recovery is assured; if it shows a black appearance he
      will grow worse and will not live. For the swelling(?),
      slice (the flesh of) a cow which has entered the stall and
      has been slaughtered during the day. Seethe it in water
      and calves' milk. Drink the result in palm-wine. Drink
      it during the day.'</p>

  <p>Generally, however, the prescriptions are not so
      elaborate as this. They are more usually of this nature:
      'For low spirits, slice the root of the destiny tree, the
      root of the <em>susum</em> tree,
      two or three other vegetable
      compounds, and the tongue of a dog. Drink the mixture
      either in water or in palm-wine.'</p>

  <p>Even medical science, however, was invaded by superstition.
      In place of trying the doctor's prescription, a
      patient often had the choice allowed him of having
      recourse to charms and exorcisms. Thus the medical
      work itself permits him to 'place an incantation on the
      big toe of the left foot and cause it to remain' there,
      the incantation being as follows: 'O wind, my mother,
      wind, wind, the handmaid of the gods art thou; O wind
      among the storm-birds; yea, the water dost thou make
      stream down, and with the gods thy brothers liftest up
      the glory of thy wisdom.' At other times a witch or
      sorceress was called in, and told to 'bind a cord twice
      seven times, binding it on the sick man's neck and on
      his feet like fetters, and while he lies in his bed to
      pour pure water over him.' Instead of the knotted cord

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>

      verses from a sacred book might be employed, just as
      phylacteries were, and still are, among the Jews. Thus
      we read: 'In the night-time let a verse from a good
      tablet be placed on the head of the sick man in bed.'
      The word translated 'verse' is <em>masal</em>, the Hebrew
      <i lang="he" xml:lang="he">m&acirc;sh&acirc;l</i>,
      which literally
      signifies a 'proverb' or 'parable.'
      It is curious to find the witch by the side of the wizard
      in Babylonia. 'The wise woman,' however, was held in
      great repute there, and just as the witches of Europe
      were supposed to fly through the air on a broomstick so
      it was believed that the witches of Babylonia could
      perform the same feat with the help of a wooden staff.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Manners and Customs; Trade and
      Government</span></h3>

  <p>The monuments of Assyria do not give us the same
      assistance as those of Egypt in learning about the
      manners and customs of its inhabitants. We find there
      no tombs whose pictured walls set before us the daily
      life and doings of the people. We have to acquire our
      knowledge from the bas-reliefs of the royal palaces,
      which represent to us rather the pomp of the court and
      the conquest of foreign nations than scenes taken from
      ordinary Assyrian life. It is only incidentally that the
      manners and customs of the lower classes are depicted.
      It is true that we can learn a good deal from the
      contract-tablets and other kinds of what may be called
      the private literature of Babylonia and Assyria. At
      present, however, but a small portion of these has been
      examined, and a literature can never paint so fully and
      distinctly the manners and customs of the day as the
      picture or sculpture on the wall. It is only in times
      comparatively modern that the novelist has sought to
      give a faithful portrait of the life of the peasant and
      artisan.</p>

  <p>The dress of the upper classes in Assyria did not
      differ essentially from that of the well-to-do Oriental of

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>

      to-day. In time of peace the king was dressed in a robe
      which reached to the ankles, bound round the waist
      with a broad belt, while a mantle was thrown over his
      shoulders, and a tiara or fillet was worn on his head.
      The tiara sometimes resembled the triple tiara of the
      Pope, sometimes was of cone-like shape, and the fillet
      was furnished with two long bandelettes which fell
      down behind. The robe and mantle were alike richly
      embroidered and edged with fringes. The arms were
      left bare, except in so far as they could be covered by
      the mantle, and a heavy pair of bracelets encircled each,
      the workmanship of the jewelry being similar to that
      of the chain which was worn round the neck. The feet
      were shod with sandals which had a raised part behind
      to protect the heels, and they were fastened to the feet
      by a ring through which the great toe passed, and a
      latchet over the instep. Sandals of precisely the same
      character are still used in Mesopotamia. The monarch's
      dress in war was similar to that used in time of peace,
      except that he carried a belt for daggers, while a fringed
      apron took the place of the mantle. Boots laced in
      front were also sometimes substituted for the sandals.</p>

  <p>The upper classes, and more especially the officials
      about court, wore a costume similar to that of the king,
      only of course, less rich and costly. In all cases they
      were distinguished by the long fringed sleeveless robe
      which descended to the ankles. The dress of the
      soldiers and of the common people generally was quite
      different. It consisted only of the tunic, over which in

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>

      all probability the long robe of the wealthy was worn,
      and which did not quite reach the knees. Sometimes a
      sort of jacket was put on above it, and, in a few
      instances, a simple kilt seems to take its place. The kilt
      was frequently worn under the tunic, which was fastened
      round the waist by a girdle or sword-belt. The arms,
      legs, and feet, were bare. Some of the soldiers, however,
      wore sandals, and others, more particularly the
      cavalry, wore boots, which were laced in front, and came
      half way up the leg. The upper part of the legs was
      occasionally protected by drawers of leather or
      chain-armour, and we even find tunics made of the same
      materials. Helmets were also employed, but the
      common soldier usually covered his head with a simple
      skull-cap.</p>

  <p>The dress of the women consisted of a long tunic and
      mantle, and a fillet for confining the hair.</p>

  <p>The king and his officers rode in chariots even when
      on a campaign. In crossing mountains the chariots
      often had to be carried on the shoulders of men or
      animals, their wheels being sometimes first taken off for
      the purpose. The chariot was large enough to contain
      not only the king but an umbrella-bearer and a charioteer
      as well. The latter held the reins in both hands,
      each rein being single and fastened to either side of a
      snaffle-like bit. When in the field the royal chariot was
      followed by a bow-bearer and a quiver-bearer, as well
      as by led horses, intended to assist the monarch to
      escape, should the fortune of battle turn against him.

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>

      The chariot was drawn by two horses, a third horse
      being usually attached to it by a thong in order to
      take the place of one of the other two if an accident
      occurred.</p>

    </span>
  </div>

  <p>Beside the chariots the army was accompanied by
      a corps of cavalry. In the time of the first Assyrian
      Empire the cavalry-soldier rode on the bare back of the
      horse, with his knees crouched up in front of him;
      subsequently saddles were introduced, though not
      stirrups.</p>

  <p>The cavalry was divided into two corps—the heavy
      and the light-armed. The latter were armed only with

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>

      the bow and arrow and a guard for the wrist, and were
      chiefly employed in skirmishing. Most of the archers,
      however, belonged to the infantry. The Assyrians were
      particularly skilled in the use of the bow, and their
      superiority in war was probably in great measure due to
      it. Besides the bow they employed the spear, the short
      dagger or dirk, and the sword, which was of two kinds.
      The ordinary kind was long and straight, the less usual
      kind being curved, like a scimetar. For defence, round
      shields, of no great size, were carried.</p>

  <p>Only the king and the chief nobles were allowed the
      luxury of a tent. The common soldier had to sleep on
      the ground, wrapped up in a blanket or plaid. The
      tent was probably of felt, and had an opening in the
      centre through which the smoke of a fire might escape.
      Not only, however, was a sleeping-tent carried for the
      king, a cooking-tent was carried also. So also was the
      royal chair, called a <em>nimedu</em>,
      on which the monarch sat
      when stationary in camp. The chair may be seen in the
      bas-relief, now in the British Museum, which represents
      Sennacherib sitting upon it in front of the captured
      town of Lachish. Above is a short inscription which
      tells us that 'Sennacherib, the king of legions, the king
      of Assyria, sat on an upright throne, and the spoil of the
      city of Lachish passed before him.'</p>

  <p>There were various means for assaulting a hostile
      town. Sometimes scaling-ladders were used, sometimes
      the walls were undermined with crowbars and pickaxes;
      sometimes a battering-ram was employed armed with

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>

      one or two spear-like projections; sometimes fire was
      applied to the enemy's gates. Other engines are mentioned
      in the inscriptions, but as they have not been
      found depicted on the monuments it is difficult to
      identify them.</p>

    <span class="caption">
      <span class="smcap">Siege of a City</span></span>
  </div>

  <p>The barbarities which followed the capture of a town
      would be almost incredible, were they not a subject of
      boast in the inscriptions which record them.
      Assur-natsir-pal's
      cruelties were especially revolting. Pyramids
      of human heads marked the path of the conqueror;
      boys and girls were burned alive or reserved for a worse
      fate; men were impaled, flayed alive, blinded, or deprived
      of their hands and feet, of their ears and noses,
      while the women and children were carried into slavery,
      the captured city plundered and reduced to ashes, and
      the trees in its neighbourhood cut down. During the
      second Assyrian Empire warfare was a little more
      humane, but the most horrible tortures were still exercised

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>

      upon the vanquished. How deeply-seated was the
      thirst for blood and vengeance on an enemy is exemplified
      in a bas-relief which represents Assur-bani-pal and
      his queen feasting in their garden while the head of the
      conquered Elamite king hangs from a tree above.</p>

  <p>The Assyrians made use of chairs, tables, and couches.
      A piece of sculpture from Khorsabad introduces us to
      a scene in which the priests of the king are seated, two
      on a chair on either side of a four-legged table. Their
      sandals are removed, as was the custom among the
      Greeks when eating. In the luxurious days of Assur-bani-pal
      the couch seems to have partially taken the
      place of the chair, since in the scene alluded to above
      the king is depicted reclining, though the queen sits in a
      chair by his side. The number of different kinds of
      food mentioned in the inscriptions seems to imply that
      the Assyrians were fond of good living. The common
      people, it is true, lived mostly on bread, fruit, and
      vegetables; but the monuments show us soldiers engaged in
      slaughtering and cooking oxen and sheep.</p>

  <p>Wine was the usual beverage at a banquet, and the
      Assyrians appear to have resembled the Persians in
      their indulgence in it. Various sorts of wine are
      enumerated in the inscriptions, most of which were
      imported from abroad. Among the most highly prized
      was the wine of Khilbun or Helbon, which is mentioned
      in Ezek. xxvii. 18, and was grown near Damascus at a
      village still called Halb&ucirc;n.
      Besides grape-wine, palm-wine,
      made from dates, was brought from Babylon, and

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>

      beer, milk, cream, butter or ghee, and oil, were all much
      used. At a feast the wine was ladled out of a large
      vase into cups, which were then presented to the
      guests.</p>

  <p>The table was ornamented with flowers, and musicians
      were hired to amuse the banqueters. No less than
      seven or eight different musical instruments were known,
      among them the harp, the lyre, and the tambourine.
      The lyre seems to have been specially employed at
      feasts, and the harp for the performance of sacred
      music. The instrumental music was at times accompanied
      by the voice, and bands of musicians celebrated
      the triumphant return of the king from war.</p>

  <p>Polygamy was permitted—at all events to the monarch—and
      the palace was accordingly guarded by a whole
      army of eunuchs. They were generally in attendance
      on the sovereign, like the scribes whose offices were
      continually needed in both peace and war. Another
      attendant must not be forgotten—the servant who stood
      behind the king armed with a fly-flap, and was almost
      a necessity in hot weather. Considering the number of
      captives carried away every year to Assyria in the
      successful campaigns of its rulers, slaves must have been
      very plentiful in Nineveh. Indeed, after the Arabian
      campaign of Assur-bani-pal we are told that a camel
      was sold for half a shekel of silver, and that a man was
      worth a correspondingly small sum.</p>

  <p>Next to hunting men the chief employment and
      delight of an Assyrian king was to hunt wild beasts.

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>

      Tiglath-Pileser I had hunted elephants in the land of
      the Hittites, as the Egyptian Pharaohs had done before
      him; subsequently the extinction of the elephant in
      Western Asia caused his successors to content themselves
      with lesser game. The reem or wild bull and the
      lion became their favourite sport, smaller animals like
      the gazelle, the hare, and the wild ass being left to their
      subjects to pursue. It was not
      until the reign of Assur-bani-pal
      that the lion-hunt ceased to be a dangerous and
      exciting pastime. With Esar-haddon, however, the old
      race of warrior kings had come to an end, and the new
      king introduced a new style of sport. The lions were
      now caught and kept in cages, until they were turned
      out for a royal <em>battue</em>.
      As they had to be whipped into
      activity, neither the monarch nor his companions could
      have run much risk of being harmed.</p>

  <p>The Assyrians were not an agricultural people like
      the Babylonians. Nevertheless, the kings had their
      paradises or parks, and the wealthier classes their
      gardens or shrubberies. The garden was planted with
      trees rather than with flowers or herbs, and afforded a
      shady retreat during the summer months. Tiglath-Pileser
      I had even established a sort of botanical garden,
      in which he tried to acclimatise some of the trees he
      had met with in his campaigns. He tells us of it: 'As
      for the cedar, the <em>likkarin</em> tree, and the almug,
      from the
      countries I have conquered, these trees, which none of
      the kings my fathers that were before me had planted,
      I took, and in the gardens of my land I planted, and by

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>

      the name of garden I called them; whatsoever in my
      land there was not I took, and I established the gardens
      of Assyria.' The gardens were abundantly watered
      from the river or canal, by the side of which they were
      usually planted. Summer-houses were built in the
      midst of them, and as early as the time of Sennacherib
      we meet with a 'hanging garden,' grown on the roof of
      a building.</p>

  <p>Fishing was carried on with a line merely, and without
      a rod. The fisherman sat on the bank, or else
      swam in the water, supporting himself on an inflated
      skin.</p>

  <p>These inflated skins were largely used in warfare for
      conveying troops and animals across a stream. The
      chief officers, along with their chariots and commissariat,
      were ferried across in boats, but the soldiers had to strip,
      and with the help of the skins convey themselves, their
      arms, the horses, and other baggage to the opposite
      bank.</p>

  <p>At times a pontoon-bridge of boats was constructed,
      at other times the Assyrian army was fortunate enough
      to meet with bridges of stone or wood. In fact, such
      bridges existed on all the main roads which it traversed.
      Western Asia was more thickly populated then than is
      at present the case, and the roads were not only more
      numerous than they are to-day, but better kept. Hence
      the ease and rapidity with which large bodies of men
      were moved by the Assyrian kings from one part of
      Asia to another. Where a road did not already exist, it

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>

      was made by the advancing army, timber being cleared
      and a highway thrown up for the purpose.</p>

  <p>As road-makers the Assyrians seem to have anticipated
      the Romans. Both their military and their
      trading instincts led them in this direction. It was only
      when they came to the water that their career was
      checked. Excellent as they were as soldiers, they never
      became sailors. The boats of the Tigris and Euphrates
      were either rafts or circular coracles of skins stretched
      on a wooden framework. When Sennacherib wished to
      attack the Chaldeans of
    <a id="TNanchor_4_4" name="TNanchor_4_4"></a>
    <a href="#TN_4_4" class="msg"
      title="Original reads 'Bit-Yagina'">Beth-Yagina</a>
      in their place of
      refuge on the Persian Gulf, he had to transport Phœnicians
      from the west to build his galleys, and to navigate
      them afterwards. It was the Babylonians 'whose cry
      was in their ships;' the Assyrians fought and traded on
      shore.</p>

  <p>It was not until the rise of the Second Assyrian
      Empire that the trade of Assyria became important.
      The earlier kings had gone forth to war for the sake of
      booty or out of mere caprice; Tiglath-Pileser II and his
      successors aimed at getting the commerce of the world
      into the hands of their own subjects. The fall of
      Carchemish and the overthrow of the Phœnician cities
      enabled them to carry out their design. Nineveh
      became a busy centre of trade, from whence caravans
      went and returned north and south, east and west.
      The old Hittite standard of weight, called 'the maneh
      of Carchemish' by the Assyrians, was made the ordinary
      legal standard, and Aramaic became the common language

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>

      of trade. Not unfrequently an Aramaic docket
      accompanies an Assyrian contract tablet, stating briefly
      what were its contents and the names of the chief contracting
      parties. These contract tablets have to do with
      the sale and lease of houses, slaves, and other property,
      as well as with the amount of interest to be paid upon
      loans. We learn from them that the rate of interest
      was usually as low as four per cent., and when objects
      like bronze were borrowed as three per cent. House
      property naturally varied in value. A house sold at
      Nineveh on the sixteenth of Sivan or May,
      <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 692, fetched one
      maneh of silver or &pound;9, the average price of
      a slave. Thus, three Israelites, as Dr. Oppert believes,
      were sold by a Phœnician on the twentieth of Ab or
      July, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 709, for &pound;27,
      retractation or annulment of the sale being subject
      to a penalty of about &pound;230, part of
      which was to go to the temple of Istar of Arbela.
      Twenty years later, however, as many as seven slaves,
      among them an Israelite, Hoshea, and his two wives,
      were sold for the same price, while we find a girl
      handed over by her parents to an Egyptian lady
      Nit&ocirc;kris, who wished to marry her to her son Takhos,
      for the small sum of &pound;2 10<em>s</em>.
      The last deed of sale, by the way, proves that
      wives in Assyria could sometimes be bought.</p>

  <p>All deeds and contracts were signed and sealed in
      the presence of a number of attesting witnesses, who
      attached their seals, or, if they were too poor to possess
      any, their nail-marks, to the documents. It was then

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>

      enclosed in an outer coating of clay, on which an
      abstract of its contents was given. Sometimes a further
      document on papyrus was fastened to it by means of a
      string.</p>

  <p>It was only in the case of the monarch himself that
      the signatures of attesting witnesses were dispensed
      with. The British Museum possesses a sort of private
      will made by Sennacherib in favour of Esar-haddon,
      when the latter was not as yet heir-apparent to the
      throne. In this no witnesses are mentioned, and it is
      considered sufficient that the document should be lodged
      in the imperial archives. It runs as follows: 'I,
      Sennacherib, king of legions, king of Assyria, bequeathe
      armlets of gold, quantities of ivory, a platter of gold,
      ornaments and chains for the neck, all these beautiful
      things of which there are heaps, and three sorts of precious
      stones, 1-1/2 manehs and 2-1/2 shekels in weight, to
      Esar-haddon, my son, whose name was afterwards
      changed to Assur-sar-illik-pal by my wish. I have
      deposited the treasure in the house of Amuk. Thine is
      the kingdom, O Nebo, our light!' Payments, it must
      be remembered, were still made by weight, coined
      money not having been introduced until after the time
      of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

  <p>The business-like character of the trading community
      of Nineveh will best be gathered from the documents
      themselves which have been left to us. It will, therefore,
      not be out of place to add here translations of some
      of the contract tablets:—</p>

      so far from being in a condition of slavery were able to

      be in the service of the state. Among the earliest
      known examples of Israelitish or Jewish writing are
      seals which probably belong to a period anterior to the
      Babylonish Exile, and have been found at Diarbekr
      and other places in the neighbourhood of the Tigris
      and Euphrates. It is also possible that the great
      banking firm of Egibi, which flourished at Babylon from
      the time of Sennacherib and Esar-haddon to that of
      Darius and Xerxes, and carried on business transactions
      as extensive as those of the Rothschilds of to-day, was
      of Israelitish origin. At all events the name Egibi is
      not Babylonian, while it is a very exact Babylonian
      transcript of the Biblical name Jacob.</p>

  <p>The contract tablets throw a good deal of light upon
      Assyrian law. In its main outlines it did not differ
      much from our own. Precedents and previous decisions
      seem to have been held in as high estimation as among
      our own lawyers. The king was the supreme court of
      appeal, and copies exist of private petitions preferred to
      him on a variety of matters. Judges were appointed
      under the king, and prisons were established in the
      towns. An old Babylonian code of moral precepts
      addressed to princes denounces the ruler who listens to
      the evil advice of his courtiers, and does not deliver
      judgment 'according to the statutes,' 'the law-book,'
      and 'the writing of the god Ea.' The earliest existing
      code of laws is one which goes back to the Accadian
      epoch, and contains an express enactment for protecting
      the slave against his master. How far it was

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>

      made the basis of subsequent Semitic legislation it is
      difficult to say; in one respect, at all events, it differed
      considerably from the law which followed it. This was
      in the position it assigned to women. Among the
      Accadians, the woman was the equal of man; in fact,
      she ranked before the husband in matters relating to the
      family; whereas among the Semites she was degraded
      to a very inferior rank. It is curious to find the
      Semitic translator of an Accadian text invariably
      changing the order in which the words for man and
      woman, male and female occur in the original. In the
      Accadian the order is 'woman and man,'
      in the Assyro-Babylonian
      translation, 'man and woman.'</p>

  <p>The high-roads were placed under the charge of
      commissioners, and in Babylonia, where brick-making
      was an important occupation, the brick-yards as well.
      Certain of the taxes, which were raised alike from
      citizens and aliens, were devoted to the maintenance
      of them. Unfortunately we know but little at present
      of the precise way in which the taxes were levied, and
      the principle on which they were distributed among the
      various classes of the population. In Babylonia, however,
      the tenant does not seem to have paid much to
      the government, since we are told of him that after
      handing over one-third of the produce of an estate to his
      landlord, he might keep the rest of it for himself. There
      is no hint that any portion of it was distrained for the
      state.</p>

  <p>As in modern Turkey, the imperial exchequer after

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>

      the time of Tiglath-Pileser II was supplied by fixed
      contributions from the separate provinces and large
      towns. Thus Nineveh itself was assessed at thirty
      talents. The best way, however, of giving an idea of
      the assessment is by a translation of the few fragments
      of the assessment lists of the Second Empire which have
      been preserved to us.</p>

  <p>In spite of the fragmentary character of these lists,
      and the difficulty of understanding them perfectly in
      consequence of their brevity and the omission of
      prepositions, we may nevertheless glean from them a fair
      idea of the method in which the imperial exchequer of
      Assyria was replenished, and the objects to which the
      taxes and tribute were devoted. A considerable amount

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>

      must have gone to the great army of officials by whom
      the Second Empire was administered. 'The great king,'
      it was true, was autocratic like the Russian Czar, but
      like the Russian Czar he was also controlled by a
      bureaucracy which managed the government under him.
      In military matters alone he was supreme, though even
      here two commanders-in-chief stood at his side, ready to
      take his place in the command of the troops whenever
      age or disinclination detained him at home. The lists
      of Assyrian officials which we possess are very lengthy,
      and their titles seem almost endless. At the head came
      the two commanders-in-chief, the Turtannu or Tartan of
      the right, and the Turtannu of the left, doubtless so
      called from their position on the right and left of the
      king. Next to them were the Chamberlain or superintendent
      of the singing men and women, and then after
      five other officials whose posts are obscure, the 'Rab-sak'
      or 'Rab-shakeh.' His title means literally 'chief
      of the princes,' and he corresponded to the Vizier or
      Prime Minister of the Turkish Empire. Among other
      public offices we may notice that of the astronomer,
      who was supported by the state like the rest, and who
      ranked immediately after the 'superintendent of the
      camel-stables.' The latter again was inferior in rank to
      the 'captain of the watch,' 'the captain of fifty,' 'the
      overseer of the vineyards,' and 'the overseer of the
      quays.'</p>

  <p>Such, then, was the constitution of the great Assyrian
      Empire, which first endeavoured to organise Western

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>

      Asia into a single homogeneous whole, and in effecting
      its purpose cared neither for justice nor for humanity.
      Nineveh was 'full of lies and robbery,' but it was God's
      instrument in chastising His chosen people, and in preparing
      the way for the ages that were to come, and for
      a while, therefore, it was allowed to 'make the earth
      empty' and 'waste.' But the day came when its work
      was accomplished, and the measure of its iniquity was
      full. Nineveh, 'the bloody city,' fell, never to rise again
      and the doom pronounced by Nahum was fulfilled. For
      centuries the very site of the imperial city remained
      unknown, and the traveller and historian alike put the
      vain question: 'Where is the dwelling of the lions, and
      the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion,
      even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none
      made them afraid?'</p>

      to my city of Assur I brought (them). From the city
      of Kitlala I departed; to the city of the Fort of Shalmaneser

      The city of Khalman [Aleppo] I approached; they
      feared battle; they embraced my feet. Silver and gold
      I received as their tribute; I offered sacrifices before the
      god Rimmon of Khalman. From the city of Khalman
      I departed; to two cities of Irkhulena of Hamath I
      approached. The cities of Adennu [the Eden of Amos

      14,000 of their troops I slew with weapons. Like
      Rimmon, the air-god, I caused the storm to come forth

    <p>Accadians, invented the cuneiform
        system of writing, founded the

        the language may be called the Latin of Asia,

        the Accadians first used hieroglyphics
        or pictures painted on
        papyrus leaves, from which the
        cuneiform characters were formed;
        afterwards soft clay was stamped
        with cuneitic symbols, and then
        sun-dried; general use of writing
        and materials employed; characters changed,

    <p><a name="Assur" id="Assur">Assur</a>,
        the name of a city on the
        western bank of the Tigris, and
        the capital of the country or district
        named after it; Assur was a

<span class="pagenum">
  <a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>

        descriptive appellation signifying
        'water-boundary' at first, but
        was slightly changed by the
        Semitic conquerors so as to mean
        'gracious;' the name of Sar, the
        god of the firmament, in time,
        was confused with that of the
        patron deity, and Assur thus
        came to signify the city, country,
        and the deity; hence Assur represented
        at the same time the power
        and constitution of Assyria, the
        'gracious' god, and the primeval
        firmament; ruins now called
        Kalah Sherghat, <a href="#Page_21">21-2</a>.</p>

    <p>Assur-bani-pal, probably 'the great
        and noble Asnapper;' succeeded
        his father, Esar-haddon,
        <a href="#Page_48">48</a>; he
        was luxurious, ambitious, and
        cruel, but a most magnificent
        patron of literature; he kept
        scribes constantly engaged on
        new editions of rare or older
        works; entrusted his armies to
        his generals, and before his death
        found the empire irretrievably
        weakened; his lion hunts compared
        with those of his warlike
        predecessors; Egyptian revolt
        crushed, and Tirhakah again a
        fugitive, No-Amon plundered,
        and two obelisks carried as trophies
        to Nineveh, <a href="#Page_51">51</a>;
        Tyre surrendered
        and the Lydians paid
        tribute; fall of Elam, Shushan
        razed, and captive kings compelled
        to drag Assur-bani-pal's
        chariot through Nineveh,
        <a href="#Page_51">51-2</a>;
        the Arabs severely punished, and
        the Armenians of Van sought an
        alliance; rebellion headed by his
        brother the Babylonian viceroy,
        with the assistance of Egypt,
        Palestine, and Arabia, and hired
        Karian and Ionian mercenaries;
        Egypt now threw off the yoke;
        Cuthah was reduced by famine,
        and Samas-yukin perished in the
        flames of his palace; Elam ravaged
        again and the last king became a fugitive,

    <p>Assur-natsir, one of the most energetic
        and ferocious warrior kings,
        also a great builder of palaces;
        restored Calah, formed a library,
        and made the city his favourite
        residence, <a href="#Page_28">28-9</a>.</p>

    <p>Assur-nirari, the last of his line,
        ascended the throne in troublous time;
        Assur, the capital, rose in
        revolt; the cities and outlying
        districts were surging with discontent;
        ten years later the army
        rebelled, and the monarch and
        his dynasty fell together,

        genius and political tact, and
        was the first king who conciliated
        the conquered nations; Egypt
        was subdued; Babylon rebuilt,

    <p>Esar-haddon II, called Sarakos by

        and prayers offered to the gods to

    <p>Merodach, originally a form of the
        Sun-god; a benevolent and intercessory
        deity, represented as
        continually passing between earth
        and heaven, informing Ea of the
        sufferings of mankind, and striving
        to alleviate them; he destroyed
        the demon Tiamat, and
        was commonly addressed as 'Bel'
        or 'Lord;' his star Jupiter; and
        his wife Zir-panitu,
        <a href="#Page_60">60</a>.</p>

    <p>Merodach-Baladan's envoys induced
        Hezekiah to join the confederacy
        of Phœnicia, Moab,
        Edom, Philistia, and Egypt,
        against the Assyrians; but Sargon's
        rapid movements surprised
        them; Phœnicia and Judah were
        overrun, and Ashdod burnt before
        the arrival of the Egyptians;
        Merodach-Baladan in his own
        country made vigorous efforts to
        repel the attack of the conqueror
        on his return; but the Elamite
        allies were put to flight, and Sargon
        entered Babylon in triumph;
        the following year Merodach-Baladan
        was pursued to Beth-Yagina,
        which was taken by

        storm, and the defenders sent in
        chains to Nineveh; Merodach-Baladan
        escaped, and two years
        afterwards again seized Babylon,
        but was defeated at the battle of
        Kis, and a second time became a

        the various deities into

        to Canaan, as seen in the names of
        a city and a mountain; had a
        temple at Bahrein under the name
        of Enzak; as a planetary deity he
        represented Mercury, and was
        often adored as Nusku, perhaps,
        the Nisroch of the Bible,
        <a href="#Page_61">61</a>.</p>

    <p>Nergal, the god of hunting and war,

    <p>Pul, a military adventurer, seized
        the crown, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
        743, and assumed
        the name of Tiglath-Pileser II;
        he was an able ruler, a good general,
        and a skilful administrator,
        and consolidated the empire by
        deporting the turbulent populations
        to distant homes, and importing
        others; he divided the
        empire into provinces, and fixed
        the annual tribute; he endeavoured
        to subvert the power of
        the Hittites of Carchemish, and
        turn the trade of Asia Minor into
        Assyrian channels, and render
        Syria and Phœnicia tributary,
        <a href="#Page_34">34</a>;
        he annexed Northern Babylonia,
        punished the Kurds, utterly defeated
        Sarduris and his confederates,
        and captured Arpad after a
        siege of two years; he stormed
        Hamath, and transplanted part
        of the inhabitants to Armenia; he
        received tribute from the Syrian
        kings, and Menahem, Rezon,
        Hiram, and Pisiris; he blockaded
        Van, and ravaged the surrounding
        country,
        <a href="#Page_35">35-6</a>;
        he was heavily
        bribed by Ahaz to attack Rezon
        and Pekah; Damascus was invested
        and forced to surrender
        through famine, and forces were
        sent against the Ammonites,
        Moabites, and Philistines; on the
        fall of Damascus it was plundered
        and the inhabitants transplanted
        to Kir; Babylonia was reduced,
        and under his original name of
        Pul, he assumed the title of King</p>

    <p>Samas, the Sun-god, was the son
        of Sin, in accordance with the

        Babylonians; he was really only
        a form of Merodach, though in
        historical times the two were
        separated, and received different
        cults; originally identical with
        Tammuz, through the myth of
        Istar, separate attributes were
        assigned to him, and Tammuz
        became a deity distinct from
        Samas,

    <p>Sargon, a usurper, claimed royal
        descent; was an able general, but
        a rough and energetic ruler,
        <a href="#Page_37">37-8</a>;
        two years after his accession
        captured Samaria, and removed
        the inhabitants to Gozan; he
        found the task of cementing
        together the empire formed by
        Tiglath-Pileser by no means easy;
        Babylonia had thrown off the
        yoke, and submitted to Merodach-Baladan;
        Elam threatened
        him on the south; the Kurds
        renewed their depredations on
        the east; the Hittites of Carchemish
        were unsubdued, Syria
        held with difficulty, and Egypt
        appeared as a new enemy,
        <a href="#Page_38">38</a>;
        he drove the Elamites back into
        their own country, suppressed
        the revolt of Hamath, and burnt
        the city; put Yahu-bihdi or Ilu-bihdi
        to a horrible death, marched
        along the coast of Palestine, and
        roused the Egyptian army at Raphia,
        taking its ally the king of
        Gaza captive,
        <a href="#Page_38">38-9</a>; he stormed
        Carchemish, took Pisiris prisoner,
        and the allies fled northward; the
        city was plundered, and an
        Assyrian satrap appointed over
        it; he had now gained the high
        road of the caravan trade between
        Eastern and Western Asia; the
        Hittite allies continued the
        struggle six years, when Van submitted,
        and its king Ursa committed
        suicide; Cilicia and Tubal
        were placed under an Assyrian
        governor, and the city of Malatiyeh
        was razed to the ground,

        Judah, Phœnicia, Edom, Philistia,
        and Egypt, but before the
        confederates were ready to act
        together, Sargon overran Palestine,
        captured Jerusalem, and
        burnt Ashdod; he next hurled
        his forces against Babylonia,
        compelled the Elamites to retire,
        and entered the capital in

        pursued Merodach-Baladan to
        Beth-Yagin, which was taken by
        storm, and the defenders sent in

    <p>Sennacherib had been brought up in
        the purple; was weak, boastful,
        and cruel, and only preserved the
        empire by the help of his father's
        veterans and generals; Merodach-Baladan
        escaped from captivity,
        and again seized Babylon, but
        was driven from the country after
        the battle of Kis,
        <a href="#Page_41">41-2</a>;

        but entire silence about the terrible
        disaster he sustained near
        Jerusalem, and his precipitate

        and appointed Assur Nadin-sumi

        <a href="#Page_42">42-5</a>; pursued

        next invaded Babylonia, and
        placed Nergal-yusezib on the
        throne; defeated the Assyrians
        near Nipur, but died soon afterwards;
        he was succeeded by
        Musezib, who defied the power
        of Assyria nearly four years, but
        was beaten in the decisive battle
        of Khalule; the following year
        Sennacherib captured Babylon,
        and gave it up to fire and the
        sword; the inhabitants were sold
        into slavery, and the waters of the
        Araxes canal overflowed the
        ruined city; his Cilician campaign
        the last; the rest of his life spent
        in constructing canals, aqueducts,
        and rebuilding the palace at

        Hazael on the heights of Shenir,

        The Kue or Kuans inhabited the northern and
        eastern shores of the Gulf of Antioch. M. Fran&ccedil;ois
        Lenormant has ingeniously suggested that in 1 Kings
        x. 28, we ought to read (with a slight change of vowel
        punctuation), 'And Solomon had horses brought out of
        Egypt, and out of Kue the king's merchants received a
        drove at a price.'</p>
